What is generative AI? Why is everyone talking about it? And what does its increasing prevalence mean for us as artists and creative media practitioners? Through dedicated study, critical thinking and creative projects, this course will give you essential knowledge and skills to orient you as a thinker and practitioner in an increasingly automated mediascape. You will gain new critical perspectives around generative AI and the various issues it presents; economically, socially, environmentally, creatively and aesthetically. Working directly with text, image, speech and video models, you will develop the skills and knowledge to understand and use (or refuse) generative AI in a critical, creative, aesthetically informed and responsible manner. You will develop your own unique workflows and methods in relation to generative AI in the context of critical scholarship, concept generation, graphic materials, experimental film-making, sound design and other emerging applications.
