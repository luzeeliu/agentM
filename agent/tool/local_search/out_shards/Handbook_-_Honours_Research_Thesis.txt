The Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) program provides students the opportunity to demonstrate learning in advanced knowledge and skills required for research in social work or a related health/welfare area. The Honours Research Thesis course SOCW4015 is the central focus of Level 4 Honours in Social Work for those students who select to undertake Honours via a Research Thesis. This course is based on a sustained, in-depth study of research methods and design integrated throughout the BSW (Hons.) program. Students will be individually supported by an academic supervisor to undertake a 12,000 word independent empirical or conceptual research project in their area of interest. The thesis will demonstrate their ability as autonomous researchers and will enable students to proceed to a Professional Doctorate in Social Work or other research degrees.
