Description
There has been a rapid growth in the use of digital spatial data in many areas of resource management and the environmental sciences. The aim of this course is to provide both a solid theoretical understanding and a comprehensive practical introduction to the use of geographic information systems and remote sensing in the analysis of digital spatial data, simple modelling using digital spatial data, and in decision support using commercially available software. Topics covered in the course provide an overview of the use of digital geographic information and earth-resource imagery for a wide range of environmental applications including geology, vegetation and forestry, agriculture, oceanographic and regional and urban analysis.
This course will be conducted through a combination of lectures, computer laboratories and field work.
