Description
This intensive course is designed to engage students who have a concern for environmental issues, particularly in the arid zones of Australia.
Students will travel to Broken Hill and Fowler's Gap, a remote desert location north of Broken Hill, where they will engage with local resources and communities to address the question of how we see, interact with, live in, and represent an arid land under environmental stress. Students can interact with the land directly or produce models, concept drawings, paintings, sculpture, photographs, video or designs that will explore sustainability, articulate their experience of the landscape and imagine new ways of interacting with this land.
This course is suitable for students studying fine arts, design, media arts, architecture or engineering who wish to explore their disciplines in the laboratory of an outback and arid environment.
There are additional charges for transport during the course and for accommodation and food.  Students are responsible for their own travel to and from Broken Hill.
Please contact the Faculty of Art & Design regarding dates of the field trip component of course.
