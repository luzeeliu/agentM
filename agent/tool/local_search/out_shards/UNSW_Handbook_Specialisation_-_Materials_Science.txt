Materials Science
Description
Materials Science is the underlying science of high performance materials including metals, ceramics, plastics, composites, electronic materials and biomaterials. It is about the science of developing high performance materials, making things from them and predicting their performance. Everything we use is made of materials and Materials Science is about developing the best materials for different applications.
Graduates of this discipline work in metals, ceramics, and plastic producing companies, the manufacturing industry, research and development, the utilities (power, water, gas, etc.), the service industries (airlines, railways, etc.), the government, consultancy, management and various areas of the sciences.
