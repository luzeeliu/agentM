This is a first-year course with a focus on chemical engineering and food science applications. This course is also a good elective for first year engineering students. Through weekly online tasks, live lectures, labs and tutorials, students build on their introductory knowledge of chemistry to explore the engineering aspects of chemistry. The course builds from the quantum mechanical structure of atoms and leads to an understanding of the periodic trends in the properties of the elements. This knowledge is applied to understanding chemical bonding and intermolecular forces which together are responsible for determining the properties of materials.
General principles of chemical equilibrium are developed and applied to chemical reactions involving acids and bases. The practical aspects of the flow of material and energy within a process are extended into applications of the laws of thermodynamics to chemical processes and ultimately linked to chemical equilibrium. The course concludes with an overview of chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including their applications in biology, corrosion, and energy storage for portable electronic devices. This course is distinct from CHEM1011/1031 in being for engineering and food science students. It is usually taken in combination with CHEM1821.
Note: Assumed knowledge equivalent to Year 12 chemistry or CHEM1001.
