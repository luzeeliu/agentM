Step into the vibrant world of Latin American resistance and discover how communities have fought back against centuries of colonial domination. This course examines the rich tapestry of resistance movements that have emerged throughout Latin America in response to colonial legacies and contemporary challenges. You will explore how Indigenous communities, social movements, cultural expressions, and political organisations have shaped ongoing struggles for justice, sovereignty, and cultural identity in the face of colonial and neocolonial power structures.
This course invites you to move beyond traditional narratives that view Latin America through frameworks of victimisation or underdevelopment. Instead, you'll discover the remarkable agency and resilience of communities who have created innovative responses to domination. From Indigenous sovereignty movements to revolutionary cultural expressions, you'll explore multiple forms of resistance that continue to shape the region today.
