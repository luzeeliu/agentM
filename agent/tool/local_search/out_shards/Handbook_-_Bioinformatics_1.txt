Bioinformatics is becoming a central enabling discipline in the life sciences with the explosion in high-throughput data generated by genomics and proteomics technologies. Bioinformatics applies the methods and discipline of computer science and statistics to the data and goals of molecular biology and provides a computational framework to analyse these data and generate new knowledge in the life sciences.
This page outlines the core program rules for the Bioinformatics stream when taken as part of a single or dual award in Science, Science (International), Science and Business, and Advanced Science.
