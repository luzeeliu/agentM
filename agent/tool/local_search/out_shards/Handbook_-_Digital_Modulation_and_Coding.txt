This course aims at students wishing to specialise in telecommunications in their degree. Modulation and Coding are two essential components of all modern digital communication systems, e.g., radio, TV, satellite, computer, cellular phones, and 3G/4G/5G systems. These two together allow for high-speed, error-free transmission over a wireless channel which is prone to noise, fading, and interference.
The course contents include:
Communication concepts: Fourier transforms, random signals, transmitter and receiver filters, matched filter, Nyquist criterion.
Digital Modulation schemes: M-ary ASK, QPSK, FSK, CPM, spectral analysis of modulated signals, ML and MAP detectors, signal space methods, bit error rate analysis.
Digital Receivers: carrier and clock synchronisation.
Information theory: entropy, channel capacity, source coding.
Channel Coding: block codes, convolutional codes.
