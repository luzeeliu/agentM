The capstone year of the MBA (Executive) Program focuses on themes of growth, innovation, disruption and transformation. As part of the capstone year, this course will focus on disruption and transformation of industries and organisations.
In this course, students learn to accept and embrace uncertainty. Industry disruption is challenging many incumbent businesses while simultaneously creating opportunities. In disruptive environments, many organisations find they need to transform their business model and their organisation. Transformation means dealing with the challenges of change and uncertainty, sensing the situation, seizing the opportunities, and transforming the organisation. This requires critical thinking to deal with the frequent paradoxical choices in today’s business environment where transformation is increasingly an ongoing activity rather than a once-in-a-career event. You will build important skills and mindsets to understand disruption, lead organisational business model shifts, and direct organisational transformation projects with confidence.
This course is designed to build upon and extend your learning in MBAE7502

, as the strategies and tools of growth and innovation also apply in developing new business models. Business model shifts and organisational transformations are complex, and this course explores many distinct types of business models as well as approaches to increase the success probability of organisational transformations.
In a world besotted with disruption, exponential technology change, globalisation, and the digitalisation of the economy, the concepts addressed in this course are of paramount importance to any leader looking to run a successful organisation into the future.
