Degradation of engineering materials occurs most commonly through corrosion and wear. This Level 4 elective course in materials science and engineering teaches students how to minimise and control the rate at which these occur to extend the lifespan of engineering components. The course is taught through lectures and laboratories and covers three main areas:
Corrosion and Control Strategies: Corrosion occurs in several ways. Students will learn the causes of each type of corrosion, and how to prevent corrosion, or reduce the rate at which corrosion occurs in established systems.
Wear: Wear occurs in many engineering applications. Students will learn about the primary mechanisms by which wear occurs, and how simple models of these wear mechanisms allow the main parameters and materials properties affecting wear rates to be identified.
Surface Engineering: Students will learn about the purpose of engineered surfaces to increase the lifespan of materials by increasing resistance to both corrosion and wear, with a focus on the hardening of steel and the common coating methods used in industry to protect different materials.
Previous knowledge of thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanical properties is required.
