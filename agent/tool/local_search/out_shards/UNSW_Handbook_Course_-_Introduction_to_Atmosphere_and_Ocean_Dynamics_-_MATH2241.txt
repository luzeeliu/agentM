Description
An introduction to mathematical models for the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans. The equations of motion are exploited so as to provide simplified models for phenomena including: waves, the effects of the Earth's rotation, the geostrophic wind, upwelling, storm surges. Feedback mechanisms are also modelled: the land/sea breeze, tornadoes, tropical cyclones. Models for large-scale phenomena including El Nino and the East Australian Current will be discussed as well as the role of the atmosphere-ocean system in climate change.
