The Masters of Engineering Science specialisation in Renewable Energy is designed to build on the previous education of engineering and science graduates looking to expand their skills to contribute to the booming renewable energy industry and broader energy transition. The specialisation develops skills for planning, design and operation of renewable energy systems and their integration into larger electricity systems. The degree covers a range of renewable energy technologies and systems, including utility-scale and distributed generation of electricity from photovoltaics, wind turbines; electricity and heat from solar thermal and biomass systems; supporting technologies including battery energy storage systems; and broader energy transition and sustainability topics such as energy efficiency, low energy buildings, life-cycle assessment, and electricity industry integration.
