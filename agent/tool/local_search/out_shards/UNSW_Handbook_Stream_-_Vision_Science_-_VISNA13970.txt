Stream Outline
Vision Science is the study of the sensory processes that underlie vision and understanding of vision-related technologies.
It is designed for students who wish to pursue a laboratory/industry focused research career by providing broad and coherent knowledge in relevant topics such as: Optics, anatomy and functioning of the eye, eye disorders, clinical optometry, ocular therapy, sensation and perception, psychophysics, and research design and methods.

Notes
Students are advised to select their courses carefully to ensure prerequisites for Stage 2 and 3 electives are met.
For students enrolled in, or applying for a transfer into a Bachelor of Advanced Science (3972) with a major in Vision Science, the course VISN1101 Seeing the World: Perspectives from Vision Science (6 UOC) will be counted in-place of SCIF1121/1131.
It is highly recommended that Advanced Science students majoring in Vision Science take SCIF2041 and SCIF3041 in Stages 2 and 3.
