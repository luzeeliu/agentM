Description
First, second and third year of the vision science course has given students strong foundations in vision science. Students already have a good understanding of light, how it is focused and how we use light to perceive the world around us using our eyes and visual system. In this course, students will be provided with opportunities to apply their foundation knowledge in solving real-world problems which are important to optometry and vision science.
Students will be introduced to lens design principles, and will learn ways of minimising the most common optical aberrations, of importance in optical dispensing. Students will also understand how the optics of current instrumentation may be improved and exploited to maximise image quality, extending and applying their studies in optics in first year. This knowledge will facilitate optical imaging and documentation skills in the clinical environment, where it is important to be able to understand how best to image specific ocular structures to aid diagnosis in the case of pathology.
In the ocular imaging component of this course, foundation knowledge in anatomy, physiology and optical imaging skills will be applied to strengthen understanding of how structure may relate to visual function. These skills are important for ophthalmic imaging technicians, sales professionals of optical imaging equipment and clinicians such as optometrists, ophthalmologists and orthoptists.
Finally, students will apply their knowledge in radiometry, photometry, colorimetry and environmental optometry in a lighting evaluation supported by the resources of a fully functioning lighting measurement laboratory. The skill of lighting evaluation is not only important for optometrists, who advise their patients, but may be of value for students who seek further qualifications in the lighting industry. This course will run as a series of lectures and practicals followed by problem-based learning assignments. By completion of this course, students will have built a portfolio to showcase their skills.
Note:
VISN3111 is assumed knowledge for this course.
