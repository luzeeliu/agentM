The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is a research degree that provides you with the opportunity to make an original and significant contribution to knowledge in an area of built environment research. The focus of a PhD is to develop a student’s expert knowledge in a chosen field and enhance their skills in research, critical and creative thinking and problem solving.
The length of a doctoral thesis normally should not exceed 100,000 words of text and should be submitted for examination within four years of full-time study.
In order to assist commencing students in developing an appropriate research methodology, all PhD candidates are required to undertake a course in their first session -

Minimum Entry Requirements

As a general guide, the minimum requirement for admission to a PhD degree is an appropriate undergraduate degree with first or upper second class honours or a completed Masters by Research degree in a field represented within UNSW Built Environment faculty or another relevant discipline.
Candidates may be admitted to the PhD program after one year’s full-time enrolment in a Masters by Research program, with the approval of the Faculty Research Committee. In exceptional cases an applicant who submits evidence of such other academic and professional qualifications as may be approved by the Committee may be permitted to enrol for the degree.

Additional Information
If you are considering applying for enrolment in a PhD, it is a requirement that you contact prospective supervisors to determine in advance if they are in a position to supervise your research topic. It is recommended that you make initial contact via email. If you are local, you should then arrange a face-to-face meeting; if overseas, ideally arrange a SKYPE interview.
The Faculty of Built Environment also requires that every Higher Degree Research applicant submit an Expression of Interest prior to applying to the university via the central online portal. For more information, please see:
