This course examines the way in which the law structures cities and suburbs. It begins by asking: what does justice mean in an urban context? Students will explore the growing literature on urban justice, including concepts of the Right to the City, the Just City, spatial justice, and environmental justice.
The course will introduce students to the legal regime for planning in NSW as well as other areas of law relevant to the built environment including heritage, environmental and property law. Drawing insights from national and international experience, particularly in the United States, students will critically examine the contribution of these legal regimes to justice in Sydney.
Main topics
Theories of urban justice
The legal framework for strategic planning and development assessment in NSW
Democracy and public participation in planning and development
Ecologically sustainable development, ecology and the city
Heritage, 'character' and equity
The relationships between property, 'community' and exclusion
Urban activism in Sydney and internationally
Trends in the governance of the built environment and their implications for justice
This course will be useful for students with interests in: environmental, property and real estate law, urban development and public policy. Cities are a fascinating topic for study, and the course will develop a critical understanding of intersections between law and fields such as urban studies, geography, economics, public health and social policy.
