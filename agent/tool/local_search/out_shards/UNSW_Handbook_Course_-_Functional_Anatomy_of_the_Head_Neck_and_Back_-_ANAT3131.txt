Description
This course follows on from ANAT1521, ANAT2111 and ANAT2511 and complements the other level III anatomy courses (ANAT3121, ANAT3141 and ANAT3411). The course aims to provide a detailed understanding of the functional anatomy of the head, neck and back with attention to the functional aspects of the cranial nerves. Lectures and practical classes focus on topography, gross anatomy and functions of the structures of the head, neck and trunk: bones, joints, muscles, innervation, blood supply and functions. This content is correlated with clinical case applications, surface anatomy and joint movement. Laboratory classes involve the study of prosected and plastinated specimens, models, medical images and surface anatomy. Tutorials focus on clinical applications of the concepts of gross anatomy, nerve root lesions and include quizzes - these will use online learning tools.
