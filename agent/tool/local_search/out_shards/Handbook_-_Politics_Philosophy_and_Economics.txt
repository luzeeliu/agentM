The Bachelor of Politics, Philosophy and Economics (BPPE) provides graduates with a uniquely powerful combination of intellectual tools with which to understand and act on the world. PPE graduates globally are recognised leaders in all aspects of public life, including the highest reaches of government, political parties and lobby groups, the public service, NGOs, and social activist organisations. It also equips students for careers in banking, consultancy work, and strategic advising to major corporations. PPE graduates are also well known as public commentators on contemporary issues. The PPE will help you bring the perspectives of three crucial intellectual disciplines to pressing contemporary national and global issues such as justice, inequality and climate change. As well as combining a carefully chosen combination of existing courses from the Politics and International Relations, Philosophy, and Economics streams, the program will include courses specifically designed to enable you to explore the synergies and tensions between them and assess their relevance to meeting humanity's most difficult challenges.
