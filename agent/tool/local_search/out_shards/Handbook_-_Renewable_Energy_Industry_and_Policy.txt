We live in a time of energy transition. What are the implications of technological change and a clean energy future? Will our energy future be centralised or distributed? What is the role of the smart grid? Which technologies and business models might emerge and what are the policy and regulatory factors that affect their viability?
In this course, we review objectives and strategies of renewable energy policy. We develop an understanding of the renewable energy industry, markets, and the policy and economics context. We examine how technologies and industries evolve and how stakeholders and institutions interact in the energy industry. We develop frameworks and skills to access and analyse market and industry data, and use these to assess the impacts of policy and regulatory change and the emergence of new technologies and business models.
Selection and design of policy instruments, including regulation, taxation, tariffs, targets, incentives and market-based schemes will be explored. Specific policy and regulatory changes, their impacts on stakeholders and business models, and interaction with the broader policy regulatory environment will be analysed for specific case studies.
