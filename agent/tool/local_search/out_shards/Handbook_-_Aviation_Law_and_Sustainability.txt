Historically, transformation in the global and domestic aviation industry occurred in the legal context of safety and economic regulation. Whilst safety is always taken as the paramount objective of aviation regulators, there is now an interpretation with associated object and purpose for a regulator to consider the impact on the environment from the operation of aircraft when developing and implementing regulations. Therefore, in this specialisation students will undertake an advanced course in aviation law and regulation, alongside tailored courses in aviation and environmental economics, sustainable development principles and policies, data analysis, and environmental performance assessment of aviation. Together the 4 courses will equip students with a specialised tool-kit to support the wide range of decision-making in the design, implementation, governance, and evaluation of sustainable practices, procedures and policies in the context of aviation organisations.
