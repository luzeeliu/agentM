This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The English major specialisation at UNSW covers literature from a range of historical periods, from the Renaissance through to postmodernism and contemporary society. It locates the study of literature in a variety of contexts: cultural, political, biographical, social, theoretical and ideological. It acknowledges the breadth and diversity of contemporary literary and cultural studies, drawing upon a range of interdisciplinary methodologies and theoretical movements, such as poststructuralism, feminism and gender studies, postcolonialism, creative writing and discourse analysis, to engage in dynamic fashion with more traditional approaches to the discipline, such as close reading, aesthetic evaluation and canon formation.
