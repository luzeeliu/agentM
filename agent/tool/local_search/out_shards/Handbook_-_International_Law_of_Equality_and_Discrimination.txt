Equality and the principle of non-discrimination are central to the enjoyment of human rights and freedoms. This course explores the fundamental principles of the international law of equality and non-discrimination and their place in human rights law. It also examines the application of these principles to selected contemporary circumstances. The course focuses particularly on sex, disability and race discrimination, looking closely at gross or entrenched violations, comparing the approaches of various domestic nondiscrimination law regimes and analysing the main policy debates. Special attention is given to the role and accountability at law of non-state actors. Several eminent guest speakers will address the class on particular topics.
This course is also available to students undertaking relevant postgraduate non-law degree programs at UNSW, provided such enrolment is approved by the appropriate non-law Faculty.
