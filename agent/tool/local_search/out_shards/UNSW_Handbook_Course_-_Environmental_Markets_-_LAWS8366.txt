Description
The overall aim of this course is to identify the key elements of environmental markets and to understand what makes an effective, functioning market. We will begin with an overview of market-based mechanisms in the environmental context and a consideration of the key design features of environmental markets. The second section will examine environmental markets across a range of sectors including climate, water, renewable energy, biodiversity and salinity. The course will conclude with an examination of the commercial aspects of environmental markets and some key considerations for negotiating and contracting for environmental goods and services.
