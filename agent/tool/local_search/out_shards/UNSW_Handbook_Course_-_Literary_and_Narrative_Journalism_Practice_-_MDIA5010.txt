Description
The course will give you the opportunity to plan and execute a strong, publishable work of narrative journalism. This course centres on long-form in-depth journalism, but with an eye on how to develop a book project.
You will read and discuss a variety of provocative pieces of literary journalism from the past few decades, while also researching and writing a 5000-word article of your own.
You will study the art of narrative journalism: the controlled delivery and interplay of character, scene, plot, perspective, dialogue and description; examining the craft’s practicalities, including selecting topics and locations, staying on target, keeping notes and records, using photography, targeting publications or publishers, and writing magazine pitches and book proposals.
If you are enrolled in the 72 UOC plan you must have successfully completed all your Cognate Courses (24 UOC) before being eligible to enrol in MDIA5010.
