Politics, power and policy are closely intertwined. Policy making involves a dynamic process that often involves conflict and compromise, and competition over values and interests. This course will equip you to critically analyse the role of the state in defining, controlling, punishing, supporting and caring for citizens and non-citizens. You will examine the influence of politics on policy making, and engage in interactive and critical discussion on who wins and who loses in the process. You will analyse the party-political context of contemporary policy debates, and consider the impact of elections, parliamentary politics, and partisan and ideological differences. You will use theories of policy change to observe the role of powerful interests and institutions in constraining and enabling genuine participation by affected communities. The course will introduce different models of political representation and engagement that explain whose voices are heard in the policy process, and whose voices are marginalised or stifled. Finally, you will reflect on how citizens hold governments accountable.
