Software plays an important role in our daily life. It is important to construct robust, operational software, especially under limited development budget and time constraints. To address this problem, a thorough verification and validation process is needed.
In this course, you will study classic and modern techniques for the automated testing and analysis of software systems for reliability, security, and performance. Throughout the course, you will gain insight into a spectrum of software quality assurance techniques, including but not limited to fuzz testing and symbolic execution. These techniques will be not only studied but also applied in real-world scenarios, providing practical skills that are highly relevant in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
