Description
Much of the information that we, as human beings, make use of is verbal in nature. This course will examine how we cognitively represent and access verbal information when producing, comprehending, and remembering language. All levels of language will be considered ranging from the smallest sounds up to full discourse within context. Evidence obtained from language dysfunction and from investigations of verbal development will also be considered.
