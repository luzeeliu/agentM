The overall aim of the Foundations course is to introduce students to the independent and collaborative learning approach that characterises the new Medicine program. Foundations is an integrated seven-week experience for new students, which requires them to work independently and in teams to explore their understanding of the fundamentals of cell biology, the structure of the human body, and a range of professional issues pertinent to medical practice. It consists of two separate but interlinked health scenarios, the first on immunisation for medical students, and the second on stomach pain. The teaching and learning methods are designed to incorporate issues such as information management, and written and oral communication. The Foundations course also provides an orientation for new students into the academic support and mentoring programs. Assessment will be by evidence of satisfactory participation in each of the various activities undertaken.
