Description
This course takes a modern approach to studying the history of change on planet Earth. The origins of the continents, oceans, atmosphere and the planet itself are considered from a variety of perspectives. The beginnings of life and evolution of selected fauna and flora are investigated from genetic and fossil evidence. The relationships between Earth's geological environments and their associated life forms are explored. The effects of change, both natural and induced by humans, on soil, water and the landscape are examined. The course is delivered by experts from across the range of earth and environmental sciences.
Note:
Skills in environmental earth science will be acquired through problem-solving laboratory tutorials and a field study camp. The field camp is compulsory and will involve some cost to students.
