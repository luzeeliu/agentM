, market trends, and operational efficiencies.
This course will guide you through fundamental business analytics methods to conduct predictive analytics. These methods are categorized into Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement learning. We primarily use supervised learning and Reinforcement learning methods for predictive analytics projects. However, in the course of a predictive analytics project, analysts may use unsupervised learning techniques to understand the data and to expedite the model building process.
You will apply these business analytics methods using Python. Python is a versatile programming language with rich libraries for data wrangling and analysis. Throughout this course, hands-on experience and business case studies will be included alongside the technical aspects of Python coding.
