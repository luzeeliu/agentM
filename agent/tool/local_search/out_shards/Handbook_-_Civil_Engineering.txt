Overview
Civil Engineering is responsible for projects that enhance the overall quality of life. Civil engineers design, construct, manage, operate and maintain the infrastructure that supports modern society including buildings, bridges, roads and highways, tunnels, airfields, dams, ports and harbours, railways, new mines, water supply and sewerage schemes, irrigation systems and… For more content click the Read More button below.
Civil Engineering is responsible for projects that enhance the overall quality of life. Civil engineers design, construct, manage, operate and maintain the infrastructure that supports modern society including buildings, bridges, roads and highways, tunnels, airfields, dams, ports and harbours, railways, new mines, water supply and sewerage schemes, irrigation systems and flood mitigation works. The profession is very broad and affords opportunities for involvement in many specialist activities.
In the final year of the Civil Engineering program students may choose electives in structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transport engineering, water engineering or engineering construction and management. This program can be taken on a four-year full-time basis, or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.
A detailed program structure can be found on the School website, which includes suggested scheduling of courses by semester. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.
