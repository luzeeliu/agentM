The Master of Curating and Cultural Leadership [MCCL] is designed for graduates and professionals who aim to play a leading role in shaping the creative and cultural landscape of the future.
We see contemporary curating as a dynamic profession, which plays a key role in setting cultural agendas and discovering new ground. We foster a vision of leadership that is deeply diverse and non-hierarchical.
The MCCL builds connections between curating, audience engagement, policy, management, critical writing, promotion, production and the many new roles emerging in contemporary digital culture.
It also builds on over 20 years of experience at UNSW Art & Design in postgraduate education for arts and cultural professionals, many of whom are now prominent leaders in the Australian and international cultural field.
Based on extensive industry engagement and consultation, we deliver our curriculum in close collaboration with UNSW Galleries and with a broad range of Australian and International industry partners. Our graduates develop strong individual practices, underpinned by robust and flexible skills in a highly networked and professionally engaged environment.
The Master of Curating and Cultural Leadership provides pathways for both those with backgrounds in museums, galleries, arts organisations, art history and art practice and those who wish to enter curating or cultural leadership from other professional backgrounds. Graduates of the Master of Curating and Cultural Leadership are prepared to be independent professionals, able to undertake leadership, research and innovation across a wide range of curating, exhibition, arts policy and management contexts.
Fully online mode is only available to domestic students and students not on an international student visa.
