Students commencing prior to 2024 should refer to the program rules for the year in which they started.
The
Bachelor of Criminology & Criminal Justice (BCCJ)
is a three-year full-time, or six-year part-time equivalent, undergraduate degree designed to critically explore the causes of crime, deviance, criminal behaviour, social control and the legal system.
The BCCJ looks at the big picture of crime by bringing together cross-faculty expertise from the School of Law, Society & Criminology and School of Social Sciences to deliver an innovative and interdisciplinary degree with a real-world focus designed to investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. You'll also learn about key institutions of criminal justice including the police, courts and prison, and the impact they have in the community. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond to crime and criminality.
The BCCJ is delivered via two core curricula, the Criminology & Criminal Justice Core and the Social Science core, ensuring you will not only gain a comprehensive understanding of contemporary criminological issues, but also an in-depth training in the applied social research and policy skills required to translate this knowledge into practice.
