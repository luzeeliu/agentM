This intermediate course within the Textiles disciplinary studio involves experimentation, research and design development for innovative and experimental applications of textile designs. Experimentation and investigation are central to creating original, innovative and contemporary textile designs, and this course allows you to develop your own experimental approach to your textile design practice. By building on textile fundamentals acquired in the introductory course, you will also develop digital textile design and diverse making techniques, underpinned by more advanced design development processes. Working with industry standard briefs will allow you to take into consideration the requirements of designing for a commercial organisation. In addition, the course traces the ways in which designs can be translated into sustainable outcomes for production by hand, machine or digitally. This commitment to sustainability and social engagement in the course enables you to analyse contemporary issues, understand a designer’s responsibility, and know how to respond to professional design briefs responsibly, ethically and with cultural acknowledgement.
