Transforming the Everyday: Domestic Futures is designed to challenge the way in which you think about and create the spaces we inhabit everyday. The philosophy behind the approach to this studio is to extend the process of design as an acquired skill through serious play, and for you to explore, examine and demonstrate your conceptual understandings.
This course will provide you with the opportunity to explore in both theoretical and practical terms the future of domestic life and domestic environments. You will explore the domestic environment and how we will live our domestic lives in the future. What the domestic environment will look like, what part technology will play and what impact our growing energy use will have on our environment and our lifestyles. You will collaborate to create studio outcomes that are informed by various disciplines to develop projects that are grounded in defensible concepts.
You will develop creative strategies to explore conventions used in design thinking, visualisation, prototyping, documentation and presentation. Building upon your foundations in theory and the practice of design, you will develop your skills and understandings so that you can better integrate strategies employed in the design process, thereby enhancing the realisation of design outcomes within particular contexts.
