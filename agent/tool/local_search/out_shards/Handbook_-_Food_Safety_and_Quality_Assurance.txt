How do you know that what you’re eating is safe? When we purchase foods from the supermarket, the consistent quality and safety of that food is often taken for granted for producers of those foods, an effective food safety and quality assurance plan can be the difference between a successful business and one that fails.
This course helps you understand the techniques and regulatory frameworks that food companies use to ensure their products are safe and acceptable, with particular focus given to the role of Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ), the Australian Food Standards Code and the Codex Alimentarius. You will look at the major food hazards and risks associated with food production and the strategies that different sectors of the food industry use to control these to create products that meet the expectations of their customers, such as Critical Control Points programs for Hazard Analysis (HACCP), Vulnerability Assessment (VACCP) and Threat Assessment (TACCP), Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL), traceability, hygiene and sanitation.
