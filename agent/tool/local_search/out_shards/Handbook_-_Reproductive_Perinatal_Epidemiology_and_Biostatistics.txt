This course aims to provide an understanding of statistics methodology and clinical appraisal for students undertaking study in a reproductive and perinatal-health related program. This course is a core subject for the Programs 9014 Masters of Women's Health Medicine and can be undertaken as an elective course in the Reproductive Medicine programs (7379, 5508 and 9065). This course aims to introduce students to research methodology and statistical analysis. Using examples drawn specifically from the field of reproductive and perinatal medicine this course will also develop in students the ability to critically analyse/appraise literature pertinent to that area. It is likely to be most relevant to those working primarily in a reproductive and perinatal health setting-in particular gynaecologists in training, sexual health physicians, primary care physicians and family planning practitioners as well as nurses, counsellors and scientists with a special interest in this field.
