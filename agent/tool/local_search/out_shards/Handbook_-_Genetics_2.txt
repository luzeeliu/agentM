Genetics is the study of inheritance and is an exciting and rapidly expanding discipline with applications in medicine, biotechnology, agriculture, and many other fields. This course provides an overview of the key concepts in genetics including gene structure and transmission, genetic variation and evolution, and regulation of gene expression. Lectures and laboratory experiments are used to demonstrate genetic theory and its application and provide an introduction to real-world research in genetics and genomics.
This course is run in parallel with an advanced version, BABS2264, which includes a research project that students complete in addition to the scheduled practical component. The advanced course is designed for students who plan to pursue research careers in genomics or related disciplines.
