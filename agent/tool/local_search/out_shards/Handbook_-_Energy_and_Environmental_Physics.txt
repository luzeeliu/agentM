This is an introductory level course in physics related to energy and environmental physics. It is suitable for students from all disciplines and has no assumed knowledge. The course has a strong focus on conceptual understanding of the material covered and an emphasis on appreciating implications and applications of the science to current world issues. To more effectively support student learning, a flipped classroom approach is used. There are laboratory and group work components in addition to the theoretical coursework.
Topics covered include energy its uses and environmental impacts, thermodynamics, heat engines, heat transfer, solar radiation and its uses, properties of fluids, alternative energy sources, photons and atoms, photovoltaic energy, nuclear science and technology, environmental effects of natural and technological radiation sources, energy management.
The course is often taken by Aviation students, so the content has been designed to be relevant to that field. For example, the lectures on wind turbines cover airfoil shapes, there is discussion of future energy sources for aviation, and the section on nuclear accidents has lessons for the failure of complex mechanical systems such as aircraft.
