The double degree of Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Education (Secondary) is a four-year program (full-time) for intending secondary school teachers. Students combine studies in Science or Mathematics with both theoretical and practical aspects of education. In the final two years of the program, students develop skills in classroom competence and spend 80 days on supervised teaching practice in allocated secondary schools.
To meet the NESA accreditation requirements for your teaching area (e.g. Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Earth and Environmental Science), students must select a specific set of science courses outlined in detail under the ‘Science Major, Method Courses and Elective Requirements’ section.
