Wireless communication is one of the fast-growing technology areas and is found in wireless systems like Global Positions Satellite (GPS) systems, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), paging systems, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) television, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, mobile phones, automobile industry, and IoT. These systems have the capability of providing global connectivity for voice, video, and data communications. Hence, there is enormous commercial interest in this technology and never enough supply of competent microwave engineers.
This course will look at the hardware aspects of wireless systems from a telecommunications engineer perspective covering both basic passive and active microwave components as parts of the microwave building blocks in telecommunication transceiver systems. The theoretical background comprises a brief recapitulation of models and high-frequency transmission principles and Smith charts, followed by mathematical representation of microwave circuits, analysis of multiport microwave networks, introduction to modern planar technologies, lumped vs. distributed planar circuits, and analysis of planar circuits. Passive and active components will be discussed.
