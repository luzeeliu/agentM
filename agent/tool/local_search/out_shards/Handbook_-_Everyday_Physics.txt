This is a fully online course that looks at everyday applications of physics. No prior physics knowledge is required. The course cover the physics behind several everyday phenomena. Uniquely, students can choose which topics they would like to study. Physics topics addressed in this course include thermodynamics, properties of fluids, basic mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves, nuclear physics, quantum physics, optics and astronomy. Basic experimental methods will be covered through simulations and simple experiments that can be conducted at home. The course would form a good basic physics knowledge for students studying life sciences, medicine and business and for those planning to sit the Gamsat exam. This is a quantitative course using algebra and trigonometry but not calculus.
