Global pandemic. War in Ukraine. Climate crisis. Deepening geopolitical hostilities. Why is the world less and less secure?
ZHSS8403 Global Security invites you to learn about the varied and increasingly complex global landscape of insecurity. It covers the theories and practices that scholars and policymakers have used to seek security, and the major architectures of global security cooperation and governance. It considers the contested values and power relations at work in global security, and the challenges of co-ordination in the face of globalised threats.
As a member of the armed forces, intelligence analyst, policy advisor, NGO staff or a concerned citizen, you will have already encountered these challenges. We will analyse their change, interaction, and effectiveness, and debate potential solutions.
