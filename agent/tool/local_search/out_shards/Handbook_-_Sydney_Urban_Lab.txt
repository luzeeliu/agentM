This intensive design studio considers the city as a site of inquiry, experimentation, and collaboration. You will explore sustainable outcomes for some of Sydney’s critical urban challenges by undertaking design interventions at the local scale. Your interventions will be both strategic and innovative, and will be based on specific design strategies, such as tactical urbanism, community engagement, models, or other experimental and imaginative design approaches. Real-life scenarios provide the setting for you to engage with key community and professional stakeholders through the design process. Key themes you will examine include strategic planning, city-shaping infrastructure and pressing concerns of densification, housing affordability, gentrification, as well as social and spatial inequality.
