This is the second of the two introductory courses in Physics. The course is examined at two levels, with Physics 1B being the lower of the two levels. The teaching activities in the course are lectures (students can choose between online asynchronous and face-to-face), labs and problem-solving workshops. The course covers electromagnetism: electrostatics, Gauss’s law, electric potential, capacitance and dielectrics, magnetic fields and magnetism, Ampere’s law, the Biot-Savart law, Faraday’s law, induction and inductance; as well as Physical Optics: light, interference, diffraction, gratings and spectra, polarization; and Introductory quantum theory.
