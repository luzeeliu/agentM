Description
GEOS2291 focuses on developing your understanding of how air and water move through the landscape and influence biogeochemical processes and ecosystems – both locally and globally. The course covers global water and energy cycles, measuring air and water quality and fluxes, water geochemical processes, microbiological biochemical reactions and gas production, and monitoring ecosystems for signs of environmental stress.
Measuring air and water quality, gauging fluxes, and assimilating information on biogeochemical processes is critical for improving our knowledge of Earth’s processes, assessing ecosystem health and quantifying the impact of human activities. Many human activities are locally altering air, surface water, soil, and groundwater quality. Case studies will be presented on monitoring the impact of agricultural, manufacturing, mining, coal seam gas, oil, and gas developments. The theory and methods of analysis presented in lectures will be linked to your own field measurements and data interpretation at case study sites in Sydney.
Water fluxes and biogeochemical processes control ecosystems. Example studies will be presented that highlight how river and wetland function under normal climatic variability, and how such ecosystems are stressed by dam construction and alterations to flow regimes.
GEOS2291 will prepare you for research in hydrology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, biogeosciences, and ecosystem sciences, or careers in land and water management, agriculture, contaminated land remediation, greenhouse gas monitoring, and environmental impact assessments of urban, agricultural, mining, oil, and gas developments.
