The Human Rights Internship Program offers postgraduate students the opportunity to undertake legal advocacy, practice, research and/or writing under the supervision of their host organisation (either a UNSW host partner organisation or with an approved self-organised host organisation) with a focus on the protection and promotion of human rights and justice initiatives.
Students with an interest in interning at a particular social justice or human rights organisation are encouraged to self-organise an internship that best caters to their interests and career goals. Approval for self-organised internships is subject to approval by the Director of Work Integrated Learning.
Under the supervision of a member of the partner organisation and an academic supervisor from the Faculty of Law & Justice, students will gain valuable experience in research, analysis, writing and advocacy on aspects of law, policy and/or practice relating to human rights and justice.
Work tasks at the internship placement must be related to human rights and justice and/or law and policy and are to be negotiated between individual interns, partner organisations and the academic supervisor at UNSW Faculty of Law & Justice. Interns are required to undertake work at their host organisation for 70 hours over 10 days during the teaching weeks of the enrolled term. and to complete their work in close consultation with their host supervisor.
The course is taught by individual supervision with online module. Assessment tasks are flexible and designed to provide a framework to create reflective learning for the student practising human rights law in a real-world context.
Students will also engage in reflective practice and complete assessment tasks under the supervision of their UNSW academic supervisor.
