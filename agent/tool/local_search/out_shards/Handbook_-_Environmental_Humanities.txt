This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Species extinction, genetically modified organisms, climate change and nuclear power are just a few of the challenges facing us today. While these are all clearly 'environmental' issues, they are also all profoundly social, cultural and political challenges. Environmental Humanities focuses on developing critical insight into the human dimensions of these environmental issues. These issues that now permeate almost every aspect of our lives, from everyday lifestyle decisions to collective and public choices concerning urban development, energy security and food production.
Environmental Humanities is an interdisciplinary specialisation that is designed to provide you with a foundation from which to understand and critically engage with contemporary environmental issues. Drawing on resources from across the humanities and social sciences, Environmental Humanities provides you with a valuable and distinctive approach to the environment, grounded in the fields of history, philosophy, geography, cultural studies, literature, science and technology studies (STS) and social theory.
