The
Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Media (B Com B Media)
is a 4 year double degree program which combines a highly valued business qualification with a program which aims to develop communication leaders who inspire innovation and change at all levels of society and who adhere to the highest ethical standards. The B Com component provides students with the fundamentals of business and the opportunity to explore their interests in one of a range of business disciplines.
The B Media component equips you with expertise to make a difference in the exciting, challenging, and constantly evolving field of media. Media at UNSW pushes you to develop confidence in a diverse and flexible mix of creative, critical, and practical knowledges. You will gain essential skills for navigating media in the 21st century so that you can collaborate effectively, and drive and respond to innovation.
It is assumed that students have a certain level of knowledge in advanced mathematics in order to cope well with the mathematical or statistical component of a business degree. If you are successful in obtaining a place without this assumed knowledge, you are strongly encouraged to consider studying a Mathematics Bridging Course before starting your degree.
This double degree provides graduates with great opportunities to work across a wide range of communication disciplines and fields.
