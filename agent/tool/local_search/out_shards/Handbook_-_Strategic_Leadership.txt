This course will constitute the final course of the Executive Year (EY) of the MBA (Executive) Program. Like its optional counterpart, MBAE7504 Leadership Immersion, the course provides the opportunity to consolidate learnings from the MBA (Executive) journey and particularly the courses that constitute the EY.
This course will do so by asking each student to reflect on their developmental and leadership journey and how that has shaped their executive/leadership identity as a capable leader of self, of other individuals and of organisations. They will use this understanding of their own developmental journey to shape a personal vision of 'where to from here', given that the successful completion of the MBA (Executive) Program is merely one milestone, albeit a memorable one, on their ongoing learning journey.
The course is structured around the concept of adaptive leadership, executive skills, resilience, and immersive leadership/experiential learning.
The course will include a residential component, which will be an immersive experience (possibly outside of the Sydney metropolitan area within 'C-Suite' business settings). It will offer a final opportunity within the Program for students to explore their perception of their identity as leaders in a challenging context. The details and setting of the immersive experience may vary between classes.
