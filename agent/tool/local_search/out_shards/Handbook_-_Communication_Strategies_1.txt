President John F. Kennedy once said in jest that the best strategies are accidental. Of course, he made the joke to highlight exactly the opposite. The best strategies are carefully architected ensembles that exhibit an exquisite symmetry and synergy of objectives, concepts, and tactics in the context of time, an uncertain environment, and assumptions. In this course you will learn that powerful concepts lie at the heart of good strategy and that these coordinate and discipline tactics. You will also learn that tactical impact is multiplied when the right concepts are brought together. Thus, this course will radically alter your thinking about strategy and its dynamics. Based on a set of commercial client scenarios that parallel real-world problems, in your major project you will research the domain in which your client operates, fashion and defend a conceptual framework founded on deep-seated communication and communication-related theory, and then develop a suite of tactics that will address the challenge. When you have completed this course, you will be positioned to offer innovative strategic communication counsel to all manner of enterprises undertaking a vast range of endeavours.
