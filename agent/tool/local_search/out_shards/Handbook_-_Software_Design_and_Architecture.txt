COMP2511 builds on the foundation of first-year CSE courses, and begins to answer the questions: "What does good software look like?" and "How do you build software that is flexible, reusable and maintainable". The course introduces students to the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and explores how OOP attempts to solve the problem of good software design.

The course also teaches an appreciation for elegantly written code, problem solving and finding well-designed solutions to problems that have longevity of software in mind.
