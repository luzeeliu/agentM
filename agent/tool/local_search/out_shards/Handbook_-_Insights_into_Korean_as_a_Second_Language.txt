ARTS3667 is one of UNSW’s professional level Korean language courses, which are designed to help you acquire specialised Korean language skills and socio-linguistic knowledge through content-based language instruction. The course provides an advanced and professional level Korean language program from a thematic approach. The primary medium of instruction is Korean. The course introduces the practical usage of Korean, analyses texts of different styles and complexity, and addresses cross-linguistic and cross-cultural issues relevant to Korean, including lexical/grammatical problems and socio-cultural implications in second-language contexts. The focus of the course is to extend and consolidate your integrated skills in Korean, especially in reading and writing skills, and to lay a solid foundation for professional Korean. You will be exposed to various authentic texts with a range of grammatical usages and a variety of topics including cross-cultural and educational themes. The course will help you gain deeper insights into the usage of Korean and cross-linguistic/cultural knowledge which will be helpful to expand your horizon and opportunities in our competitive global professional world.
