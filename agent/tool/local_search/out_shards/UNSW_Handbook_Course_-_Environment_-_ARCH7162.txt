Description
Within the context of integrated design this subject explores the potentials and limitations of interdisciplinary ecological design as an approach to improving the sustainability of existing buildings and built-environments, and as a process of innovation for non-residential building design. These issues will be explored through assessment and monitoring of building performance, metabolism, comfort and services for non-residential buildings, construction ecology, and case-studies of advanced integrated design. Students will participate in a number of short design exercises responding to these issues that are designed not only to enable them in this aspect of architectural design but to develop a critical awareness of the limitations of current practice.
