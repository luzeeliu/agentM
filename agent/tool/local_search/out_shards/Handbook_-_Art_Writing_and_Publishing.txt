Critical writing is a key part of the contemporary art ecology and is changing rapidly alongside new digital technologies and networked practices. This course will introduce you to creative, critical, and professional art writing and publishing. You will engage with different modes of writing and publishing in relation to contemporary art and design. The role of writing and publishing in an increasingly interdisciplinary and digital context will be considered: this will include engagement with catalogue essays, curatorial statements, journal papers and online articles. The course focuses on the practice of writing (voice, register, style, structure and editing) and art and design communication strategies in the creative and cultural industries. You will engage with leading Australian arts publications to gain experience and knowledge in the field. You will also work individually and collaboratively to develop advanced critical reading, writing and editing skills.
