Seen as the highlight of study at UNSW, Biomedical Engineering Thesis Projects provide a unique opportunity for you to bring together the engineering principles learned over your previous years of study and apply these principles to develop innovative solutions to unsolved engineering problems related to human health. This could include the development of a specific design prototype, process and/or the investigation of a new scientific hypothesis.
Thesis projects are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for your creativity, and the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. There will be multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning. Thesis Projects are completed over three terms under the course codes BIOM4951, BIOM4952 and BIOM4953.
While the project may develop as you explore new gaps in the scientific and engineering knowledge the overarching research themes and supervisor are retained across terms. BIOM4953 is the final step of this exciting capstone project opportunity and your research journey. BIOM4953 is the continuation of BIOM4952 and must be on the same topic. A pass mark in BIOM4952 is required before proceeding to BIOM4953 and should be completed with the same supervisor.
