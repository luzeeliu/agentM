This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Public policy concerns the ways governments make decisions and allocate resources, and how these decisions impact our lives. The policy process is multifaceted and complex with different actors and interests that seek to influence outcomes at global, national, and local levels. In this minor, you will discover how policy is made and how policy problems are defined. You will explore the politics, values and ideology behind the decisions. You will develop skills to analyse policy, use evidence to develop policy advice, work with stakeholders to shape policy, and evaluate policy outcomes. You will reflect critically on the impact of policy on specific sectors and communities. You will explore the different ways that citizens, businesses, communities and advocacy organisations can participate in policy making that affects them, and work with government in formulating policy and delivering services.
This minor is designed to complement your disciplinary major and develop policy-relevant skills to help you to make an impact in your chosen field of practice. It will prepare you for careers in government, politics, media, think tanks, international and local non-government organisations and businesses with an interest in solving problems and influencing social change.
