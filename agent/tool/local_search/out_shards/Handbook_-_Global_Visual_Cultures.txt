This course explores contemporary histories of visuality, from early ethnography to avant-garde cinema verité to post-documentary experiments with the truth. Set within a broad and emergent field of global visual studies, this course examines critical moments in the social, political and historical role of film, art and media activism to explore how vision has been shaped and transformed by technologies of the camera. Beginning with the invention of photography, the course tracks theories of representation and cultural production across a range of visual practices and platforms, including video, satellite television, digital and the phone-made, AI, VR, immersive new media, Tubesites/the blogosphere/vlogosphere, as well as short and long form documentary and feature films. With a focus on Australian practices in relation to transnational histories and contexts, the course introduces theoretical frameworks and interdisciplinary techniques of critical ethnography, documentary and decolonial analytics to advance your skills in visual literacy and art analysis.
