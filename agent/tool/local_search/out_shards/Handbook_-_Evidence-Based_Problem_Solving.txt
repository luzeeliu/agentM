Effective problem solving is a core capability of a successful business professional, and UNSW Commerce students need to demonstrate problem solving initiative and confidence in their studies and professional careers. Evidence-based Problem Solving introduces students to the fundamentals of a deliberate and structured approach to problem solving, balancing analysis and judgement, to avoid the common pitfalls of problem solving in organisations. The importance and power of evidence, and familiarity with the different sources of evidence, are critical for identifying, solving and communicating a problem.
Starting from business problems that organisations are confronted with, students will develop their ethical judgement, reasoning and analysis skills, and work with both quantitative and qualitative data as a preparation for critical interpretation of data.  In addition to developing an analytical mindset and new ways of working with data, students are also introduced to the basic statistical skills required for working with small data sets. This prepares students for working with big data sets and mastering common analytics tools in COMM1190 Data, Insights and Decisions. This course is a fully problem-based learning course that starts with a multi-faceted problem.
