The
Bachelor of Actuarial Studies/Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics)(Honours) (BCom/BSc (Adv Maths)(Hons)
is a 5 year dual degree program which will meet the needs of students wanting an advanced program of study in mathematics or statistics, complemented with a strong, focused actuarial studies program. As part of this program students will complete a major stream in both a selected area of mathematics or statistics (from UNSW Science), and a sequence of actuarial studies courses within the UNSW Business School.
The Advanced Mathematics(Honours) component includes a single major and a research project, as well as the award of class of honours based on performance on the honours year. Majors are defined on the Advanced Mathematics (Honours) Program (3956) page.

3589 Actuarial Studies / Advanced Mathematics (Hons) specific information
keyboard_arrow_down
MATH1151 & MATH1251 are compulsory core courses that count towards the Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics)(Honours). Students must complete an additional 12 UOC of UNSW Business School electives to complete the requirement for 96 UOC of Business School courses.
1. MATH1151 Mathematics for Actuarial Studies and Finance 1A (6 UOC) replaces MATH1141 Higher Mathematics 1A (6 UOC)
2. MATH1251 Mathematics for Actuarial Studies and Finance 1B (6 UOC) replaces MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B
This applies to any stream that requires either of these courses.
If you wish to count MATH2901 and MATH2931 toward the Advanced Mathematics (Hons) degree, you must complete more Business elective courses to achieve meet the minimum Business School Course requirement.
