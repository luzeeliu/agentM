The School of Biomedical Sciences Honours course is run over three terms. It provides advanced research training in medical science research, including the disciplines of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. You will undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on advanced disciplinary knowledge, the use of specialised techniques relevant to your chosen research area, critical thinking and scientific communication. You will also gain experience in scientific writing and oral presentation via the submission of two written assessments - a literature review and a research manuscript based on substantial independent research activity - and two seminars. The course is also comprised of compulsory online Research Skills modules (via Moodle), School of Biomedical Sciences (SBMS) seminars (UNSW-based students) and Departmental/Research Institute/Lab Group seminars throughout the course.
