Architectural Fabrication expands your knowledge and understanding of construction material properties and their integration with architectural forms. The course is focused on exploring the role of the building façade, as a multi-layered system able simultaneously to deliver thermal comfort and empower interaction between inside and outside of a building. You will be provided with new tools and methods to understand the technical narrative behind architectural case studies. You will also explore and develop the relationship between design and tectonics in your own projects. The course is a combination of technical analysis and workshop-based experimentation directed to understanding the hierarchy of building components and the logic behind architectural construction. Modern conceptions of architectural tectonics will be explored, and physical precedents analysed.
