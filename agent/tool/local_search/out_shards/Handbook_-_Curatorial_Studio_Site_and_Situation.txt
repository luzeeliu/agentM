This curatorial studio supports you to operate creatively, critically and effectively within the contexts of site specific and public art. It provides opportunities to analyse real-world public art projects and to extend and apply this knowledge as you develop your own curatorial project outside of conventional exhibition spaces. The course focuses on historical debates and contemporary theories that frame curatorial practices in public space. It connects you with emerging ideas about site specificity, performance and temporary events, social engagement, modes of spectatorship and participation, as well as strategies of intervention, collaboration, and appropriation. From this informed position, you will be supported to develop collaborative, speculative and experimental curatorial approaches that incorporate project planning and delivery strategies for working in non-traditional scenarios.
