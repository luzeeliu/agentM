What does it mean for a limit to exist? What does it mean for a function to be continuous or differentiable? There are functions which are continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere! Are there functions whose integral does not exist? In this course, we look again at the essential concepts of limit, continuity, differentiability and integrability and try to place them on a sure footing. The syllabus includes material on sequences and series of real numbers and also of real valued functions. Although of general interest to those studying mathematics for its own sake, this course is of special relevance to those planning a career in secondary teaching.
MATH3570 is a compulsory component of the program for mathematics teachers.
