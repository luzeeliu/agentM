This course introduces Algebraic Topology, one of the most vibrant subjects of late nineteenth-century and twentieth-century mathematics, with important applications to physics, differential geometry, algebraic geometry and analysis, increasingly also to chemistry, biology and other sciences. You will learn and apply notions of category theory like functors and natural transformations, of homotopy theory as well as notions of homological algebra like homology studied in the particular case of complexes obtained from arbitrary topological spaces. Tutorials will discuss problems that will enhance the understanding acquired in the lectures.
This course is suited to students who have successfully completed both MATH3711 (Algebra) and MATH3701 (Differential Geometry and Topology), and are looking to expand on their knowledge from these courses.
