This course is an extension to Aviation Research Project (AVIA5020) where each student is required to complete a project that involves an original investigation to determine answers to questions that are relevant and useful to development in chosen areas of aviation. The structured, supervised project may involve researching aspects of the student's employment organisational functions, or some other area relevant to the aviation industry.
The course is specifically designed for students who would like to either analyse secondary data or collect primary data as part of their chosen research area. The course builds on the skills learnt in Aviation Research Project (AVIA5020), including the formulation of research question(s), aim(s) and objective(s), as well as the use of relevant scientific and technical resources to develop a literature review of the selected research topic. Additional research skills introduced as part of this course include principles of research ethics, data collection methods and basic data analysis techniques.
In addition to providing students with an opportunity to develop their skills in data collection and analysis, it is an opportunity for students interested in PhD pathways to best prepare for undertaking these respective projects.
