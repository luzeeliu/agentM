This course covers the basic physical principles and processes which govern our atmosphere and its climate. Firstly, students are provided with an overview of our the Earth’s atmosphere, the main physical principles that govern its behaviour, and how to apply them to important questions about weather and climate. This overview draws on foundational theoretical and applied concepts in physics and chemistry (including calculus); shows students an important application of basic physics (and a bit of chemistry); and for Oceanography, Meteorology and Climate students, in preparation for future courses in their Programs, this provides a foundation upon which later courses will build. As part of their learning, students will be introduced to concepts including the ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, how to use charts to determine the likelihood of storms developing, why deserts occur at certain latitudes, and how to forecast the weather. Students will then have the opportunity to consider these concepts in an applied context and practise their skills through activities that integrate real-world problems and situations. This skill will add value to the work that students have already invested in learning those principles and will be relevant no matter what later path in life they take.
Furthermore, both mid-term and final exams will be organised as oral exams, supporting students to learn and gain confidence in communicating within interview-style situations; an essential life skill for the rest of their careers.
