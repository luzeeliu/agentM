This course covers, in detail, the types and applications of ground segment used in space missions. It is intended to give the student a deeper understanding of the requirements and functions of the ground segment, building on the fundamentals taught in other courses in the Satellite Engineering discipline.
To achieve this, this course covers three aspects of the ground segment design: 1. Ground segment management, including mission planning, client/end-user requirements, flight operations segment requirements, payload data segment requirements and ground segment system designs; 2. Ground segment engineering, including ground-based communications design, data processing, data relaying, mission operating equipment, payload ground support, instrument operation and calibration and satellite simulation; and 3. Applications of the ground segment including data downlinking, up-linking, relaying, tracking, and ranging.
Examples of current and past ground segments of space missions are used to illustrate the design process and design implementation. Where appropriate, the theory associated with the preliminary analysis of the operation and performance of the ground segment is also presented. This course delivers to the student a broad overview of the engineering principles involved with the management, design, development, testing, and implementation of the ground segment of a space mission.
