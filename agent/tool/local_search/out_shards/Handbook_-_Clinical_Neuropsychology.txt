This course introduces clinical psychologists to the principles of neuropsychology. The course commences with an overview of the neuroanatomy of the brain, followed by discussion of major areas of cognitive function that can be disrupted by focal brain lesions. Some common neurological disorders will then be described including characteristic presentations on cognitive testing. The course will finish with a focus on rehabilitation of brain injury and evidence-based practice for interventions to address neuropsychological disorders.
This course is designed to equip Clinical Psychologists to safely interact with, assess and treat adults with acquired brain damage. It is expected that candidates who have completed PSYC7210 will be confidently able to undertake basic neuropsychological assessment and prepare reports for real clients, under the supervision of a professional psychologist. They should also be able to interpret neuropsychological reports written by others, appreciate the importance and influence of cultural context on the manifestation and impact of neuropsychological impairment, devise therapy programs that take into account cognitive deficits and appreciate how a psychologist operates within a multidisciplinary team. The course entails 2 x two hour lectures each week, which will include case discussions. It is expected that students will spend an additional 6 hours per week reading and researching each topic discussed in class.
