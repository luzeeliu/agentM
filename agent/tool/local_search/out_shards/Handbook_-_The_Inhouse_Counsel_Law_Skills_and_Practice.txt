The aim of the course is to address the law and specialised skills that a growing part of the legal profession, inhouse counsel, needs to be able to perform their role effectively and ethically.
Inhouse counsel are the key legal advisor for their client and interact with the senior decision makers of their organisation as well as external stakeholders.  Inhouse lawyers typically need broad-ranging knowledge of the law but also a keen awareness of commercial drivers.  At the same time the inhouse lawyer is subject to the ethical and professional requirements of the legal profession, giving rise to novel challenges.  The inhouse counsel needs a range of skills and the ability to deftly apply them, including leadership and teamwork, independence and collaboration.
Topics to be covered will include:
Thinking and Practising like an In-House Lawyer
The In-house Counsel Team – Leadership and Collaboration
Shaping the Organisation’s Culture
Interacting with the C-Suite
In-house Lawyers and Ethics, including independence, client identification, confidentiality and legal professional privilege
Managing External Partners and Outside Bodies
Technology and Legal Services Delivery
The Compliance Role
Managing Large Scale Litigation
Managing Major Transaction.
