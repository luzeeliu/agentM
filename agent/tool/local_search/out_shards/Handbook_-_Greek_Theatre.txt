In this course you will examine the history and development of Greek theatre from its emergence in Athens in the 6th century BC out of earlier proto-dramatic forms of dithyramb and mime, and the influence of its legendary founder, Thespis. You will then trace theatre’s rise to religious, political, and social eminence during the Classical period (5th and early 4th c.) where it formed the centre-piece of the Athenian religious festival, the Great Dionysia. You will also look at theatre’s later evolution during the late Classical and Hellenistic era (late 4th and 3rd c.) into a form that was politically neutral but still enjoyed great popularity. Finally, you will consider the great influence Greek theatre had on many artistic forms around the world, up to the present day: Shakespearean plays, Japanese Theatre, Shadow play, etc.
As well as the historical development and impact of Greek theatre, you will consider aspects of staging these productions, including physical elements (theatres, props, costumes, etc.), performers (actors, chorus, musicians), and regulation (producers, judges, audiences). Due attention will be given to the great tragic and comic playwrights (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Menander) and you will read a selection of their key surviving dramas. Ancient criticism of drama from Aristotle, Plato and others will also be examined and assessed.
