Embedded systems comprise over 99% of all computer systems in operation. They are designed for specific purposes ranging from household appliances, such as microwave ovens and set-top boxes, to sophisticated real-time controllers used in fly-by-wire aircraft and the Large Hadron Collider. The study of embedded systems encompasses the design of both software and hardware and considers important economic factors including cost, performance and reliability.
The Embedded Systems stream in the Computer Science program exposes students to both the underlying hardware technologies and the techniques for controlling hardware programmatically.
