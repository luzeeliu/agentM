This course is taken three times over three consecutive terms, and forms the research project component of the Masters of Physical Oceanography 8518. The three instances of the course each form part of the one project.
For the research project component, a student will undertake independent study in the appropriate area of physical oceanography. The student will be supervised by at least one member of the academic staff of the School of Mathematics and Statistics, possibly jointly with an academic external to the School, or a suitable person in a non-university research position. The student will write a report and give an oral presentation on the project to the Physical Oceanography department.
The written report will be assessed on four major areas:
exposition
literature coverage
critical analysis and insight
originality
The weighting of these components will depend on the type of report, as determined by discussion between the student and supervisor(s) when the topic is chosen. All theses are expected to address all four areas.
Two academic staff members will assess the thesis. The supervisor(s) are expected to provide a report on the thesis but they may not be one of the two markers.
The written thesis mark will account for 90% of the final grade; the oral presentation for the other 10%. The final mark awarded will be decided at specially convened meetings. Students will receive a marker's report on their written thesis, outlining how the final mark was decided and possibly listing errors that ought to be corrected.
