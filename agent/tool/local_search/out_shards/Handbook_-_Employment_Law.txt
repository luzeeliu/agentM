Employment law is and will be relevant to all students throughout their lives, as well as being particularly topical presently. LAWS3028/JURD 7328 - Employment Law will cover the study of individual employment relationships in Australia.To ensure that students find the course relevant, Employment Law will draw on student experiences, case law, and the use of hypotheticals.
Employment Law is one of the elective subjects for law students and is able to be taken without any prior knowledge of the area or pre-requisite courses. It will be an important component of a rounded legal education, as it is the type of law that impacts on the practice of most other types of law.
Main Topics
Students will learn about:
what distinguishes employee / employer relationships from other relationships in which work is performed;
formation, duration and termination of the contract of employment;
terms expressed, implied or otherwise incorporated into the contract of employment;
the rights and liabilities of employers and employees under contract, legislation, awards and industrial instruments;
limits on employer prerogative; and
what remedies are available to employers and employees for breach of employment contracts, regulations or awards.
