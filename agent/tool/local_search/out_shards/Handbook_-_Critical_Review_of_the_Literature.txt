This course is a major research-based investigation into a subject related to the student’s area of specialisation. It can be seen as a building block for ARCH 1482 and CODE4200, but it is a standalone project and yields its own outcome – a critical review of the computational design literature. This leads to a culmination of a well-informed understanding of the chosen research topic. It is expected that the critical review of the literature will offer a critical interpretation of the existing knowledge and literature. The length of the final as submitted literature review, should not exceed 8,000 words.
