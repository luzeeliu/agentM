Students must complete 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Commerce (96 UOC)
Integrated First Year Courses (42 - 48 UOC) - BCom/BSc students that are required to take MATH1031, MATH1041, MATH1231 or MATH1241 or MATH1251 or PSYC1111 will not be required to take COMM1110. Otherwise students should study COMM1110 to enable enrolment in COMM1190
myBCom (0 UOC)
Commerce major (48UOC)
Prescribed Work Integrated Learning Course - Requirement can be satisfied by taking either a Commerce or Science WIL course. Please note that not all Science courses in the Employability Experiences list may meet WIL requirements. Contact science.industry@unsw.edu.au with inquiries about the Science WIL courses.
Final Year Synthesis (0 - 6 UOC) - Requirement can be satisfied by taking SCIF3000, however students will still need to complete 96 UOC of Business courses

3529 - Major Course Substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
For any majors that require ECON1202,  MATH1011/MATH1031/MATH1131/MATH1141/MATH1151 completed under the Science component will act as a substitute so in these cases a student should not do ECON1202 but instead complete another Major elective to meet the 48UOC requirement.
Students should select the MATH or PSYC course required for their Science major. If a Science major does not require an equivalent MATH course (for example the Pathology major) students should complete COMM1110. MATH and PSYC count towards Science and COMM1110 count towards Commerce. If you have completed a Science course that excludes COMM1110, then you will need to study another 6UOC of UNSW Business School elective in order to meet the 96UOC from the Business School requirement.

Limit Rule
keyboard_arrow_down
Students may complete up to a maximum of 60 UOC of any level 1 courses for the Commerce component of the double degree. FINS1612, MGMT1002 and COMM1822 completed within a major/minor may count as level 2 courses for the purpose of not exceeding the level 1 limit within the BCom program.
