Classical electrodynamics is important from both the fundamental and applied viewpoints. This course aims to provide students with an introduction to the principles of electrodynamic systems, and a theoretical foundation in classical field theory. The course begins with a detailed study of scalar diffraction and related topics in physical optics. This is followed by a discussion of radiating potentials and the use of Green’s functions for solving problems in electromagnetism involving moving sources. Finally, the topic of relativistic electrodynamics and its covariant formulation is introduced, paving the way for a quantum field theory of electrodynamics (QED). Topics to be covered include; scalar diffraction theory, image formation and Fourier optics, coherence, Green’s function solution of static problems, inhomogeneous wave equation and Green’s function solution, dipole radiation, emission of radiation from accelerating and decelerating charges, relativistic electrodynamics, the covariant formulation. The course is taught as four weekly lectures, a weekly tutorial and two four-hour laboratory sessions, scheduled throughout the term. Laboratory experiments are chosen to provide practical demonstrations of topics covered in lectures.
