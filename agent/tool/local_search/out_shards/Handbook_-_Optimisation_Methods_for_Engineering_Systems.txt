This course will enable students to acquire an understanding of optimization concepts in engineering system designs and the application of optimization algorithms in mechanical, manufacturing, and mechatronic systems. Topics to be covered include classical optimization approaches with gradient based methods, linear and quadratic programming. The course also introduces metaheuristic optimization approaches such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ants colony optimization algorithms. The focus will be on the selection of an appropriate technique for an optimization problem in the above mentioned disciplines. Projects and exercises to be assigned include the choice, design, and implementation of optimization algorithms to solve practical engineering problems in mechanism design, manufacturing task scheduling, and robotic trajectory formulation. Students will practice in developing computing algorithms to solve engineering optimization problems with emphasis on effectiveness and efficiency.
