Australia has more than enough sun and wind power to completely electrify and have more to sell to our neighbours. But how are we going to do this?
In answering these questions we need to address:
How do we transform our coal fired power stations to run on sun and wind?
How do we make our houses and buildings more sustainable?
How do we integrate electric cars and plug them into the new grid?
Where will all the new jobs be in the new renewable energy economy?
Exploring the topics of electrification, new technologies, policy and social barriers and other key issues, this course will give students a greater insight into one of the most important policy challenges confronting Australia and the world today. This course encourages students from all disciplines to engage in a series of interactive face to face lectures and group collaboration via a flipped-classroom.
