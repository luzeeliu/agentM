Description
The links between the communities of developing and developed countries today are most strongly reflected in the links between developed countries NGOs and the grass roots NGOs of developing countries. This course critically examines the expanding role of NGOs and their different social and economic capital building and governance activities within developed and developing countries and the relation between them. The origin, constitution and role of a range of specific local, national and international NGOs will be tracked and analysed. The critical role of NGO partnerships and other relationships to achieving sustainable development is considered. The regulatory framework within which NGOs operate in a range of settings is examined. The impact of different aspects of NGO management relating to relationships, governance, public policy, advocacy, objective setting, fund-raising and other areas is explored. This course is taught in parallel with ARTS3754 with different classes and assessment.
