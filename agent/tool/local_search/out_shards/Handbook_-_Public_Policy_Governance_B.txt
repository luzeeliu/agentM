The following information applies to students commencing from 2022.
If you commenced prior to 2022, please refer to the specialisation requirement of the year you started.
Policymaking plays a key role in the management and change of the economy and society. Policy is part of every field of practice, which has led to a rapid growth in the need for policy professionals in government, business, and social and political organisations.
The Master of Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) applies a social science perspective to questions of policy and management in modern organisations. You will acquire a solid grounding in policy analysis, policy evaluation and social research, the necessary skills and knowledge domains required for effective engagement within the policy process. You will be able to specialise in an area of direct relevance to your own interests, which may include Social Policy, International Development Policy or Policy Management.
The program will prepare you for professional practice, by fostering analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policymaking, the significance of research and evidence in driving policy change and the role of stakeholders in effective policy implementation. The Master of Public Policy and Governance places emphasis on developing the skills and perspectives needed for proficient assessment, evaluation and sensitivity to the effectiveness of policy programs in terms of the impact they have on clients, customers and the public.
Unique to the UNSW Master of Public Policy and Governance is the significant policy and research experience of the program's teaching staff. At UNSW, the staff involved in the MPPG have had direct experience either as policy makers or policy researchers in government, non-government organisations and, the business sectors. Combined, they have over 20 years direct experience working at high levels inside government, from providing policy support to the Council of Australian Governments through to conceptualising, designing and implementing large scale policy across the states. Staff are also actively involved with non-government organisations in providing effectively policy research and evidence to support their advocacy and lobbying activities. These teaching staff bring their real life experience to the classroom, revealing the relationship between theory, research and everyday practice.
The Master of Public Policy and Governance aims to prepare you for work which requires analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policy-making and implementation. The program is oriented to the practice of policy, and prospective students are required to have relevant work experience. This may be in the public sector, unions, business or community organisations.
