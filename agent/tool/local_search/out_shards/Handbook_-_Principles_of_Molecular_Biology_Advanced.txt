This course provides an introduction to modern molecular biology and covers the molecular mechanisms of gene expression and fundamental aspects of recombinant DNA technology. The major topics covered include: the structure, function and properties of DNA and RNA; the replication and transcription of DNA; protein synthesis (translation); regulation of gene expression; molecular biological techniques (e.g. DNA cloning, hybridisation analysis, DNA sequencing, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microarrays); bioinformatics; and applications of molecular biology. The practical sessions of this course have been designed to complement lecture material and introduce students to current experimental techniques in molecular biology.
