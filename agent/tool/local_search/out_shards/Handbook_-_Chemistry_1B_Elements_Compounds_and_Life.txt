CHEM1021 covers a range of fundamental concepts that can be used to explain phenomena in chemistry as well as the biological, medicinal, and material sciences. Students who have completed Chemistry 1A previously will build on their skills to explore topics such as kinetics, structure determination, stereochemistry, transition metal chemistry, and the study of organic chemical reactions and mechanisms. The course concludes with a capstone exploration of application of organic and inorganic chemistry to synthesis, including real world situations such as drug, development, functional materials, environmental chemistry, and renewable energies.
Students will engage with weekly digital lessons that introduce content which is extended in live lectures, problem solving workshops and tutorials. The weekly laboratory class gives students hands on experience while placing course theory into context.
