DPBS1120 will introduce students to creative thinking tools, design thinking and lean canvas methodology to generate, develop and evaluate innovative ideas and concepts for complex societal or business challenges.
Across every business function, creativity is central to solving complex problems, exploring new strategies and working effectively within an organisation. We implement creativity through a diverse exploration of the drivers and motivations of stakeholders, before applying a convergent project management process to implement an effective solution.
This course takes a hands-on project-based approach, focusing on the big picture challenges facing businesses in the 21st century. We explore how business can react to ‘black swan’ events (events which come as a surprise and have a major effect on those involved), working through these complex practical challenges in diverse student teams. This gives students ample opportunity to develop their creative mindset, identify and test different ideas, and learn how to present their content in an engaging and persuasive way to influence others.
Link to other courses: DPBS1120 is recommended to be completed in the first term of the Bachelor of Commerce degree (or equivalent in a double degree). The concepts and skills learned are highly relevant to gain a deeper understanding of Creating Value (DPBS1180) and will also complement learning in Evidence-based Problem Solving (DPBS1100).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
