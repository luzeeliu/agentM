This course provides mathematical skills and knowledge similar to the NSW HSC Mathematics Extension 1 high school subject. It can serve as a bridging course for students who need to take MATH1131 but do not have the necessary assumed knowledge. It covers functions and their inverses, limits, continuity, differential and integral calculus as a grounding for a more rigorous treatment of these topics in MATH1131. Also covered are sequences and series, mathematical induction, the binomial theorem, probability, and an introduction to vectors in 2 and 3 dimensions and solving systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. The Maple computer algebra package is used to complement hand calculations. It is assumed that students will have mathematical background knowledge equivalent to a Band 4 in HSC Mathematics Advanced.
