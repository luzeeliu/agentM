This is a Level 3 Information Systems (IS) course that concludes your study of IS through the application, integration, and synthesis of your knowledge from previous IS courses. Specifically, INFS3605 is the ‘capstone’ IS course that is centrally organised around practical, experiential, group software projects. Throughout the course, you will apply programming knowledge, critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills to solve real-life problems. The course employs a real-world industry challenge. You will form a group with your classmates to engage in active learning and problem solving. You will also have the opportunity to collaborate with industry mentors to co-develop software solutions for the industry challenges.
Throughout 10 weeks, your group will engage in an iterative development process in designing and refining your proposed solution. Specifically, you will use the Agile Scrum framework in developing your project, working in two-week sprints/iterations. Throughout the problem-solving process, you will progressively develop your skill portfolio by reflecting on your learnings and obtaining feedback from peers and the teaching team. In a group setting, you will perform various roles (including scrum master and product owner) and ceremonies (including sprint planning, stand-up sessions, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, and backlog refinement), as well as utilise a number of tools (such as kanban boards, burndown charts, and planning poker) to help with collaboration.
