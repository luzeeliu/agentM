Description
After completing this course, you will never see the world the same way again. This course provides an overview of how the eyes and brain work together to enable visual perception. The overview includes an introduction to the structure and function of the human eye and visual brain. You will also learn about the professional pathways open to vision scientists and optometrists and how discoveries in optometry and vision science are used to improve vision and combat disease. The course also builds the graduate attributes required by vision scientists and optometrists by providing an introduction to research and communication skills including critical thinking, statistics, collaborative research and group presentation.  It is the first course in the vision science major in the science or advanced science programs and in the optometry program.
Assumed Knowledge: HSC Mathematics is assumed knowledge. HSC Physics is recommended knowledge. Bridging Courses are available to students entering UNSW; these courses usually run in January - February, before the start of Semester 1. Students who do not have the appropriate assumed or recommended knowledge are strongly advised to undertake the relevant Bridging Course/s, or other appropriate preparation.
