The course will introduce statistics, mathematics and associated techniques for analyzing an industrial process for the purpose of maintaining and improving it. Major disciplines covered include data collection, data analysis including statistical process control, 6-sigma analysis and decision-making. The course focuses on developing experimental techniques using statistical methods to test the performance of the processes in a manufacturing industry. It lays the foundations for testing products, components, machinery and processes. This is necessary for the development of quality products. This leads to the development of quality assurance methods for products as well as the development and understanding of the reliability of the processes on the shop-floor. This is necessary to maintain maximum up-time and return-on-assets for a manufacturing facility.
