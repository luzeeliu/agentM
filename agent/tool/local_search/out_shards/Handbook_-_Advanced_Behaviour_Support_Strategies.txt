The focus of this course is on applied behaviour analysis, and how it is accomplished through the use of functional behavioural assessment and skills training.
You will learn about the models, theories, and philosophies that form the basis of sound inclusive educational and behavioural practice.

You will practice collecting and analysing data and use this information to write behavioural intervention plans. You will also use the knowledge gained in the course to design and implement a social skills training lesson.
