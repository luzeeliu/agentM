This course introduces you to theories and concepts of the relationship between civil society advocacy, policy and state institutions, and social change in the digital age, blending class-room, online, and experiential learning and teaching activities.  You will work in groups to design and prototype an online advocacy campaign on a policy issue of your choice. The increasing importance of digital advocacy and activism for policy change, and the opportunity for higher order cognitive engagement - beyond desk based research and analysis – that technology now offers makes this course a timely contribution to the professional development of those working in policy and advocacy as well as informing those in related areas as to its role in policy change.
