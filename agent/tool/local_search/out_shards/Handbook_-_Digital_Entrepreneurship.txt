In this hands-on course, you’ll use approaches from lean start-up, design thinking and socially responsible innovation to launch your own start-up. Your teachers and UNSW Founders – Australia’s most comprehensive university entrepreneurship program – will provide support and guidance at every step. First, you’ll devise and launch a bare-bones version of a new enterprise that solves a specific problem for a niche group of people. Then, you’ll prototype and experiment to test the riskiest assumptions underpinning your idea and pivot depending on what you discover. Along the way, you’ll learn critical transferable skills such as website building, explainer video production, stakeholder interviewing, rapid digital upskilling, and Shark Tank-style pitching. You’ll also discover why entrepreneurial skills and attitudes have become essential for forging contemporary careers regardless of whether you want to explore a side hustle, innovate within an existing organisation, or raise funds and launch your own venture in the global marketplace.
