In this course, students will examine the principles and practices needed to restore terrestrial ecosystems, with a focus on the use of translocation. The course will include a one-week intensive field course based at the Wild Deserts project site, a UNSW ecosystem restoration and translocation project in the far north-west of New South Wales. Lectures and workshops delivered during the week will explore the ecological principles of restoration, provide opportunities to learn a range of ecological techniques used to measure the success of restoration and monitor management actions, and how to use scientific practice to evaluate the outcomes of restoration projects.
The course requires students to travel to the Wild Deserts project site, and there will be costs associated with travel and accommodation to be borne by the student.
