Description
Systematics investigates historical aspects of evolution and establishes evidence-based classifications and genealogical relationships between organisms. Phylogenetic systematic also known as cladistics, provides a basis for hierarchical classification, which provides a framework for examining other evolutionary and biological events, such as historical biogeography, sexual coevolution, host-parasite coevolution are also used in applied research such as in conservation biology and biodiversity. This course is designed to introduce the principles and application of phylogenetic systematic using a variety of organisms. The laboratories will place emphasis on the use of computer software and examples from major clades of the Tree of life.
