How does social and political science differ from other kinds of social or political analysis, for example, journalism? In what sense are the social and political sciences scientific? How do theories, evidence, positionality, and value commitments come together in the social and political sciences to produce knowledge? In this course you will consider fundamental questions about what social and political knowledge is and how it is acquired. You will be introduced to the disciplinary debates around these questions. You will then learn how rival theoretical traditions variously emphasise the individual, groups, institutions, classes, systems, and culture in explaining social and political phenomena. To this end, you will examine landmark works in social and political science that have sought to explain real-world social and political phenomena, from the micro to the macro (e.g. voting behaviour, ‘glass ceilings’ and ‘glass cliffs’, social revolutions, the Holocaust). This course will enhance your understanding in your other Arts & Social Sciences subjects, equip you to conduct theoretically sophisticated social and political inquiry, and empower you to assess knowledge claims about social and political life in general.
