Greek myths have had a profound influence on our culture. Because they comment on the enduring aspects of the human condition, they continue to be a major source of inspiration for contemporary philosophers, visual artists, writers and filmmakers. An understanding of this influence greatly enhances our appreciation of modern culture. In this course, you will be introduced to the creation myths, to the stories of the gods and their interaction with humans, and to the great mythical cycles – Oedipus, the Trojan War, Orpheus. The myths are discussed in relation to modern works incorporating new versions of the stories. You will also study 'The Odyssey', a monumental piece of literature with interesting historical references and an ongoing influence on western culture.
