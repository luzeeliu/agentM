Description
This course aims to provide undergraduate students in Optometry and Vision Science with an understanding of physical and geometrical optics.
Physical optics: the wave nature of light, superposition of waves, interference, diffraction, polarisation; Geometrical optics: rectilinear propagation of light, refraction and reflection at plane and spherical surfaces, prisms, thin lenses, thick lenses, optical systems with multiple surfaces, schematic eyes, simple magnifiers, compound magnifiers, stops, pupils and windows.
Assumed Knowledge: HSC Mathematics and Physics. Students will be expected to have achieved a mark of at least 90 in Mathematics and Mathematics Extension 1 is highly recommended.
