Note: This code for this course was previously SDES9761.
Contemporary graphic design is in a constant state of flux. As a result, the ways in which we develop, consider and use typefaces is more diverse than ever. This course will explore methods by which you can generate and formalise a typeface using originality in research techniques. The course will help you understand how that typeface can then be integrated into contemporary print and screen applications. This course also gives you the opportunity to reconsider issues of legibility and readability in historical and contemporary typographic practices.
