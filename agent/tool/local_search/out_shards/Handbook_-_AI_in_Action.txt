AI in Action introduces you to the practical application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in solving real-world challenges. This course emphasises hands-on, activity-based learning, allowing you to experiment with AI tools and techniques to understand the potential and applicability of AI across various contexts. For example, applications could include image recognition, natural language processing, and voice technologies, though the specific focus areas may vary. While the expectation is not for students to develop and implement new AI tools and gadgets, you will engage in practical exercises to apply existing AI tools. This will allow you to critically assess current AI capabilities and limitations to address real-world challenges in various industries.
Activities will be structured to provide hands-on experience with AI applications, gradually building your confidence in interacting with AI. In addition, you will work on a team project that leverages the AI applications for real-world problem-solving. Designed to be inclusive and accessible to students from all disciplines, the course goes beyond mere AI applications to foster problem-solving while emphasising the ethical and responsible use of AI.
By engaging with the interdisciplinary use of AI tools, you will not only gain insight into AI’s transformative role in industries such as business, design, media, and the arts but also develop timeless skills,  such as broader understanding of AI fundamentals, critical thinking, and problem-solving. While you will engage with evolving AI technologies, the emphasis is on understanding fundamental AI concepts, evaluating AI outputs, and applying AI in real-world scenarios. More importantly, you will have the opportunity to apply the Responsible AI principles explored in the course to real-world scenarios. By fostering strategic and ethical AI thinking, the course will equips equip you with long-term skills that remain valuable despite technological advancements.
While the use of AI tools may be introduced in each faculty’s individual courses, this course provides a structured, interdisciplinary environment where you actively experiment with AI application tools, apply them across various industries, critically evaluate their effectiveness and risks, and design and implement mitigation plans to alleviate them. This will allow you to gain deeper expertise and confidence in integrating AI into your career, complementing what you learn in other courses. No coding skills required to undertake the course.
