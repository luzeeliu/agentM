This course focuses on coastal resource and hazard assessment and builds skills in science, management, communication and policy-based solutions for coastal problems and issues. The course is designed for students aspiring to pursue a career as an environmental manager, environmental consultant or applied scientist. Case studies and topics on Australian coastal zone policy, conservation, impacts of soil and water acidification, global aquaculture issues and management, coastal dunes and wetlands management, coastal hazards such as sea level rise, erosion, beach safety, and coastal monitoring and community education, are used to understand how science informs management. The course considers Australian and global perspectives on current and emerging coastal resource and hazard management issues. The course includes lectures, lab classes and field excursions. Assignments build skills in writing ministerial advisories, management briefs, funding proposal writing, and production of professional standard coastal management plans, reports or management and science communication and educational tools.
