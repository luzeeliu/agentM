If you see yourself as the expert driving the 5th industrial revolution that promotes sustainable development and the most sought-after professional in transport electrification, you have come to the right place. A high level of automation that you see in a self-driving electric car, robotic arms in the industrial process or wind energy conversion is possible by efficient control of electric motor drives. Electrically actuated processes and systems deliver high energy efficiency, product quality, and highly flexible and high-volume production of items that are used every day.
The course is offered as an elective to undergraduate and postgraduate electrical engineering students aspiring to specialise in power engineering. In this course, you will gain knowledge of variable-speed drives and motion control systems used in many industrial processes. The course stresses the basic understanding of the characteristics of machines driven by appropriate power electronic converters and controllers. You will explore the steady-state behaviour and the design of high-performance drives. The dynamic issues and control system design will also be covered. You will gain hands-on experience via lab experiments and computer modelling of motor drive systems using simulation platforms such as MATLAB-Simulink.
