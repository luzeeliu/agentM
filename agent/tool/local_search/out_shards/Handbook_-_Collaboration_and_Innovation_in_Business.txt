“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For while knowledge defines all we currently know and understand, imagination points to all we might yet discover and create.”(Albert Einstein). This course will introduce students to innovation processes and creative thinking tools to generate, develop, and evaluate innovative ideas and solutions for complex business challenges.
Across every business function, collaboration and innovation are central to solving complex problems, exploring new strategies, and working effectively within an organisation. We implement a process that follows a divergent phase of problem exploration, convergent problem definition, divergent solution development, and convergent solution delivery, all delivered within a structured and scaffolded collaborative context.
The course takes a hands-on and applied project-based approach, focusing on the big picture challenges facing businesses in the 21st century. We explore how through a business lens, students can work through these complex practical challenges in diverse teams. This gives students ample opportunity to develop their creative mindset, identify and test different ideas, and learn how to present their content in an engaging and persuasive way to influence others.
