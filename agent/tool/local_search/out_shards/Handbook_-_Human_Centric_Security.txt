This course explores the intersection of cyber security and human behaviour, emphasising the importance of designing practical systems that are not only secure and robust technically but also in operation in an environment involving humans. It delves deeper than traditional cyber security, exploring the crucial role human behaviour plays in strengthening and weakening the security of systems.
The course is rooted in core security principles and helps students assess the security of systems at an individual, societal, and national level. Students will study how different categories of people (e.g. users, designers, and developers) interact with computing systems and understand the challenges in creating and evaluating human centric security systems.
The course takes an interdisciplinary approach and integrates academic research from computer science and information security with other disciplines, such as psychology, to provide a well-rounded perspective into designing practical solutions to complex cybersecurity problems.
