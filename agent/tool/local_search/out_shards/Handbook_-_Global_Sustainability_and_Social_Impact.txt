In a complex and interconnected global business environment, business professionals are faced with ever-changing challenges and opportunities. Global Sustainability and Social Impact provides current and future managers with business knowledge, skills, and frameworks for thinking to make the most of these challenges and opportunities and enable the generation of sustainable value for business and society at large.
Centred on the creation of sustainable value for business and society at large, sustainability has become a key concern of business as organisations work to contribute to social, economic and environmental sustainability through their strategies and practices. Social Impact captures the new ways in which businesses are working together with governments and civil society to create positive social outcomes through design, organisational structure, and processes of distribution.
This specialisation will equip students with the business knowledge and skills for ensuring sustainable success in the 21st century global economy. It offers a genuinely interdisciplinary approach to the crucial issues of sustainability and social purpose, drawing on fast moving and rapidly expanding fields of knowledge and practice.
