The Graduate Certificate in Mining Engineering offered by the School of Minerals and Energy Resources Engineering is designed to provide a flexible entry point for individuals with qualifications in other technical disciplines or those who possess relevant professional experience in the mining industry. This program is ideal for individuals who wish to transition into mining engineering, enhance their existing skills, or gain specialised knowledge in mining engineering without committing to a longer qualification.
This postgraduate certificate is particularly suited to individuals with relevant industry experience or professional experience in the mining sector who seek to formalise their knowledge and skills with a recognised academic qualification. By offering a more flexible entry mode, the Graduate Certificate enables students to enter the field of mining engineering and pursue further education if desired, such as progressing into the Graduate Diploma or Master of Mining Engineering.
Upon successful completion of the Graduate Certificate, students will be awarded 24 Units of Credit (UOC). The program can be pursued either full-time or part-time, with flexible delivery options that accommodate the schedules of working professionals. Courses are typically delivered in block mode, either face-to-face or online, providing intensive, short-term study blocks that allow students to continue their professional commitments while enhancing their qualifications. Some courses may also be offered fully online, providing additional flexibility for those unable to attend in-person sessions.
NOTE:
Some electives may only be offered every two years.
Courses are offered in intensive block mode or fully distance. Students should contact the school at mere.admin@unsw.edu.au for a copy of the latest MINE PG Coursework Calendar.
International students on a student visa are required to study no more than one third of the program online.
