This is a compulsory course for Social Sciences honours students in the School of Social Sciences. It will introduce you to the practice of thesis writing and support you in the early stages of developing your honours argument. This course includes topics such as: using library resources for honours students including research consultation and access to databases; the role of methods in research and the use of theory in framing and conducting a research project in the social sciences; your ethical responsibilities as a researcher; and planning and managing a research project; working effectively with your supervisor; time and data management skills. The course introduces you to the idea of framing your research as an intervention in a disciplinary debate (or series of debates). A particular focus of the course is introducing students to the thesis form. This includes learning about the component parts of a minor-thesis, and thinking about how you might construct your own thesis, for maximum impact.
