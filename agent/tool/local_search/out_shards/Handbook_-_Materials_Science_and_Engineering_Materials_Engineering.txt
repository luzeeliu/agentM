The Materials Engineering specialisation equips students with a comprehensive understanding of the structure-properties-performance nexus of materials. Students also learn about sustainable manufacturing and recycling technologies employed in both their production and end-of-life reuse. These foundations enable students to gain proficiency in designing and selecting materials for specific applications while considering the entire lifecycle impact of a material, a crucial factor in the overall decision-making process.
A range of exciting new thematic electives allows students to focus on the science and engineering of materials in key areas such as medicine and health, electronics and communications, transportation and infrastructure, and energy and the environment.
The overall program is supported by innovative lecturing technologies, hands-on laboratory work, company site visits, research and design projects, and industry training. Students also develop skills in computational methods, data analytics, engineering management, and professional communication.

Demonstrate proficiency of knowledge in the enabling sciences (mathematics, physics, and chemistry) that form the foundation of materials engineering.
keyboard_arrow_down
2.
Demonstrate expertise and specialist technical knowledge in materials engineering, including thermodynamics, phase equilibria, reaction kinetics, diffusion, phase transformations, heat transfer, fluid flow, mechanical behaviour, and physical properties.
keyboard_arrow_down
3.
Identify, describe, predict, and quantify the structure of the principal classes of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites) and relate these to the processing required to make them and to their resultant properties and applications.
