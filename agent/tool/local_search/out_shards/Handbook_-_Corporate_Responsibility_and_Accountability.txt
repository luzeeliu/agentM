Corporate Responsibility and Accountability is a core course for the Global Sustainability and Social Impact specialisation in the Master of Commerce, and an elective for those undertaking the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact, Graduate Diploma in Social Impact or MBA Programs. It examines how business manages its social, environmental and economic impact on society. The course first reviews the historical evolution and development of the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Citizenship and why it is now a key part of managing the business enterprise. Second, the course examines what acting responsibly means for corporations in terms of the market, community, environment, workplace and government. Issues covered include business and human rights, business-community partnerships, corporate philanthropy, the human resource management implications of CSR, business and the environment and businesses' relationship with government. Third, the course examines how business accounts for its behaviour and impact in society through sustainability reporting and the role of external assurance and outlines debates on the appropriate role of government policy in either regulating and/or enabling responsible corporate behaviour.
