The Honours program in Aviation aims to help students achieve, through research, a deeper and skilled understanding of a specific aspect of aviation while developing their critical thinking, writing and presentation skills. Students undertake a supervised research project in an area of research significance as approved by an academic supervisor. The research project is complemented by research skills seminars and advanced lectures and workshops. Through the taught component of this course, students will critically examine academic and industry developments within aviation with particular emphasis towards the chosen area of their thesis. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Aviation can be found at
http://aviation.unsw.edu.au/future/honours.html
.
Honours in Aviation can be completed full-time or part-time. Students commence their enrolment in terms 1, 2 and 3. Full-time students will enrol in the honours program for three terms and part-time students for six terms. Students should check with undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.
Students must enrol in AVIA4003 School of Aviation Honours Full-time (16 UOC) for three terms, or AVIA4004 School of Aviation Honours Part-time (8 UOC) for six terms.
The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).
