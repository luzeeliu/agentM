This course provides basic knowledge in mineral processing and extractive metallurgy and is delivered to students who have no training in this area. After completion, students are expected to be equipped with basic concepts and knowledge to work effectively with metallurgists/ mineral processing engineers in the field.
The course begins with an overview of mineral processing and its associated disciplines, such as mineralogy, and hydrometallurgy, which are required for the production of metals and other products from mineral ores and wastes. Topics covered include comminution, physical separation, flotation, leaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning/refining.  These unit operations are also discussed in case studies which cover base metals grinding and flotation circuits, Carbon-In-Pulp for gold processing and copper heap leaching-solvent extraction and electrowinning circuits.
Videos and YouTube sites relevant to the field are collated for the course, and students are advised to go through them to see how mineral processing is performed in mining operations.
