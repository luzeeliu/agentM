This course is split into two parts - Aviation Security and Air Freight Logistics.
Aviation is a complex set of procedures and activities that when brought together results in a secure and efficient transport system. Any interruption to that system, can and will have far-reaching effects on public confidence and their expectations, government oversight, delays and costs to industry, and the potential for loss of life and suffering.
Aviation security as applied to airlines and airports must be risk-based and outcomes focused. It must be tailored to the specifics of the airline or airport. Whilst it is conceded that approximately 80% of risks are known and common to all airports and airlines, the location, operating environment, brand, and political stability will all provide unique challenges to the aviation security professional. Aviation security takes a layered approach to protecting an aircraft, passengers and crew and is about reducing the risk whilst adding these elements to the aircraft.
Driven by the ever-increasing demand for speed, transparency, and efficiency in global trade, the air freight logistics industry has become a critical pillar of aviation management. It plays a vital role facilitating the movement of essential goods like pharmaceuticals, manufactured products, and humanitarian aid across borders. While air freight accounts for only a small fraction of global trade by volume, it carries a significant 35% of its total value, highlighting its importance in today's economy. This rapid and efficient transportation of high-value, time-sensitive goods relies on a complex network of interconnected stakeholders, including airlines, freight forwarders, ground handling agents, border agencies and more. Each participant in the supply chain plays a crucial role in ensuring the seamless and timely movement of cargo shipments. This part of the course delves into the core principles, operations, and regulations governing the air cargo industry, exploring its supply chain, commercial aspects, operational practices, and emerging trends.
This course provides insight into contemporary security issues of airlines and airports, aviation security standards and recommended practices, and aviation security principles and procedures. It will also develop your skills to ask, “What is the desired security outcome, and can it be achieved in different ways?”.  The course also introduces the framework for understanding how airfreight is moved and managed, the many demands placed upon the industry by a wide range of stakeholders, and what is needed for the airfreight industry to be successful at both an operational and business level. Unless otherwise stated, the Australian examples used throughout the course are typical of international practice.
