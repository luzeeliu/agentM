Why is Germany criticised for being too dominant in European affairs, but also for not playing a bigger role on the international stage? Such questions can only be answered by studying Germany’s radical transformations since the end of the Second World War, which this course does from diverse perspectives with an emphasis on major scholarly and contemporary debates. You will examine Germany’s occupation by the victorious Allies, its Cold War division into communist East and capitalist West, its unexpected unification after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the emergence of the ‘Berlin republic’ as a major economic and political force. You will explore how Germans sought a new beginning in the rubble of defeat; about social, political and generational change in East and West Germany; and about the difficulties of uniting East and West Germans since 1990. You will also learn about Germany’s ongoing struggle to define its national identity; its approach to migrants, refugees and increasing cultural diversity; and its changing role in Europe and the world.
