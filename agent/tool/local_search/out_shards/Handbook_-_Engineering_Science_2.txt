The Graduate Diploma in Engineering Science program is designed for engineers and graduates wishing to develop and expand their knowledge and skills in their current discipline of expertise. This will enable students to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards and to provide opportunities for continuing professional development, as well as the opportunity to interact with those at the cutting edge of their discipline.
Students will add breadth to their knowledge of engineering in general and expand their knowledge and skills in engineering management. Students will develop their technical knowledge and ability to analyse engineering problems. They will also gain further skills in solving engineering problems and justifying professional decisions.
The program is designed to enable students to fulfil a number of needs including:
- Updating technical knowledge and skills in an existing engineering specialisation
- Acquiring new knowledge and skills in a different engineering specialisation
- Developing and expanding knowledge and skills in engineering management
- Updating qualifications and knowledge to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards
- Providing opportunities for continuing professional development
- Providing opportunities for interaction with those at the cutting edge of the discipline
- Providing a pathway towards the Master's program.
