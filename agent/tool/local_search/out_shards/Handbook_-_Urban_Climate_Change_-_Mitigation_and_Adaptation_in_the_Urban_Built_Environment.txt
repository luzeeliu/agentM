In this course, you will learn about urban climate problems together with the relevant mitigation and adaptation design techniques and technologies to counterbalance the temperature increase in the urban built environment. The first part of the course, will explore the major issues around the climate of cities, will offer advanced knowledge on the interaction between the urban climate, buildings, and open spaces, and will analyse the main impact of local climate change on energy, indoor and outdoor thermal comfort, health, and economy. The second part of the course will explore, analyse, and present in detail the major mitigation and adaptation design techniques and technologies to counterbalance the urban temperature increase. It will investigate and present issues related to the appropriate use of materials in cities, new advanced and cutting edge materials for open spaces and buildings, heat dissipation and amortization technologies for buildings and open spaces based on the use of low temperature environmental sinks, smart energy and environmental management technologies for cities, Anthropogenic heat avoidance technologies and all aspects related to the proper use of urban greenery in the urban built environment. Examples from successful real case studies will be presented. You will present and analyse modelling techniques to simulate the thermal characteristics of cities and evaluate the impact of the main mitigation technologies.
