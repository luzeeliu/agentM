Food engineers develop and design large-scale technologies that can produce tonnes of foods per hour to provide healthy and nutritious foods for the world population. As a food engineer, you are responsible that food and drink products are of high quality, safe, and healthy, working towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) to improve global food systems, reduce their impact on global warming and optimize the use of water and energy. Your knowledge of chemical engineering, chemical product engineering or manufacturing engineering brings valuable skills to transform the food industry, allowing you to effectively scale food production while ensuring that our food supports and improves both individual and planetary health. You will work with food scientists, food technologists, nutrition professionals, product developers and marketers to innovate and develop new food products and processes. Food processing at scale requires the understanding of the core subjects from your engineering Honours stream, while also understanding the biological complexities of foods. Foods are perishable having a certain shelf life, they are ingested with the purpose of nourishment and enjoyment – so processing must retain, or enhance, their nutritional characteristics. As a graduate from this stream, you will be a sought-after professional who can excel in food manufacturing, with unique skills, able to lead multidisciplinary teams that work towards nourishing the world’s growing population.

3.
Use systems thinking to guide engineering practice, including articulating constraints on product or process design, analysing competitive intellectual property to identify opportunities in markets and technologies, and providing a basis for product scale-up and manufacturing.
keyboard_arrow_down
4.
Use appropriate resources, including research data, to analyse food product characteristics, create quantifiable product benchmarks, develop sustainable, holistic approaches while dealing with uncertainty and solving complex food engineering problems with actual social and environmental contexts.
