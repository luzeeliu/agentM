Computer modelling of complex physiological systems and their interaction with medical devices is becoming increasingly important in modern medical device design. This course provides a practical overview of computational modelling in bioengineering, focusing on a range of applications including electrical stimulation of neural and cardiac tissue, implantable drug delivery, cancer therapy, biomechanics and blood flow. You will be introduced to the basic principles of modelling and simulation of dynamic physical systems using ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as how to implement and solve models using Matlab and COMSOL Multiphysics numerical software.
