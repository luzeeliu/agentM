Expand all
Portfolio
keyboard_arrow_down
To gain entry into this program based on professional experience and portfolio, a minimum of 5 years industry experience is expected. Applicants who do not meet the standard entry requirements for this program may submit a portfolio for consideration as an alternative entry pathway.
Portfolio Submission Minimum Requirements:
1) A 10 page A4 digital portfolio of original design work undertaken by the applicant. We will request portfolios not meeting these standards to be resubmitted.
The portfolio must:
- Evidence design development of the selected design outcomes such as preliminary sketches, illustrations, lo and hi fidelity prototyping, model-making, and/or material experiments;
- Highlight design outcomes rather than background research, therefore limit the inclusion of user investigations, personas, demographics, user journey, precedents, competitor analysis etc.
- Include a critically reflective text on each design work (100 words max.);
- Be easily legible on screen (must not have multiple pages or excessive content condensed to a single A4 page);
- Caption all material (visual, written or AI generated) and use academic references for material that is not the applicant’s original work.
2) A cover letter that explains your interest in studying at UNSW Art & Design, and your interest in the degree. The letter should tell us about your interests, achievements and experience and be no more than 400 words.
3) Applicants must provide verified evidence of professional experience in design, or in a media-related field such as digital media, film, animation, game design, interactive media, advertising, or online content creation. This evidence should be in the form of a written statement from an employer, client, or commissioning agent confirming the applicant’s role, responsibilities, duration of engagement, and relevant project outcomes.
