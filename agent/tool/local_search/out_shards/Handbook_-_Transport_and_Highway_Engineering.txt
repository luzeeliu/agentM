This is the first introductory course in the discipline of transport engineering as part of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering. An outline of the field of transport engineering and its relationships with other engineering and non-engineering disciplines is provided within the course.
The course comprises two strands.
- Strand one focuses on analysing, designing, and evaluating traffic and transport systems. It includes traffic flow theory and the "4-step transport modeling" method to determine travel demands, which are essential for infrastructure feasibility assessments and ensuring smooth operations.
- The second strand provides a brief overview of the geometric design of Rural Highways and Roads. Topics include an introduction to road design, route location process, and design practice of urban and rural roads.
