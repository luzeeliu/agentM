Description
Are you interested in the natural environment and how humans interact with it? Understanding how different environmental processes influence atmospheric, physical and biosphere systems is crucial for understanding many environmental issues and is essential knowledge for careers in environmental science and related fields. This course covers a range of topics including climate and weather, landscape and soil evolution, hydrology, rivers and coasts, biodiversity and biotic patterns – both from global and Australian perspectives. Key environmental issues discussed include climate change and storms, land degradation, water resources and pollution, flooding, coastal erosion and bushfires. A major theme of the course is the interaction of humans with the environment and the causes of environmental problems and hazards. The course has a reputation for engaging lectures, uses innovative and interactive practical labs and a field trip to enhance an appreciation of a range of environments and issues.
