This course examines the characteristics, source and fate of metals and organic contaminants in natural and urban environments. Primary and secondary dispersion of elements and weather processes. Principles of vapour, water, soil, drainage sediments, rocks and vegetation geochemistry as applied to environmental assessments; aqueous geochemistry and contaminant modelling, with reference to Australian case studies. Introduction to sampling, analytical techniques and design of environmental surveys.
Note:
Fieldwork of up to 3 days duration will involve geochemical surveys at a contaminated site and students will incur some personal costs.
