Drones and related robotic/autonomous platforms of wildly-varying shapes and sizes are permeating society across recreational, commercial, defence and scientific uses. This is due to their ability to use autonomy and AI to perform processes for numerous industries such as humanitarian aid, logistics, and infrastructure and environmental monitoring in far safer and more efficient ways than crewed air flight - in many sectors, drones save lives or achieve exceptional improved outcomes for communities. Yet, they can also have applications that raise important ethical and privacy questions to be discussed.
This course will cover historical, current, and future uses of drones and the legal/regulatory, ethical, and technological considerations that drive the evolving acceptance or resistance to their use. The course is delivered online with asynchronous, interactive, self-paced content each week. In addition, course staff will be available online for weekly student interaction and assistance for project work, with synchronous discussion and presentation sessions related to assessment. Fun hands-on sessions flying drones (<2kg) on the UNSW Aviation Kensington campus will be available as an option to any students enrolled in this course at no additional cost. Through these sessions, students can gain practical in-person experience to complement their learning in this course.
