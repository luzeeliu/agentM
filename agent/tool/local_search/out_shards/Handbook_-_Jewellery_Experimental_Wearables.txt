This course develops your knowledge, skill and understanding of designing and making contemporary wearables. You will focus on contemporary jewellery that challenges the nature of wearables – experimenting with materials, scale, and explorations of the conceptual relationships between jewellery and the body. Self-direction is encouraged as you acquire and apply skills in developing and articulating a project brief.
You will engage in a series of preparatory workshops to introduce materials and processes suitable for the finished wearable or series of wearables. There is a focus on material experimentation, conceptual development, and a technical understanding of jewellery and object design as applied to the body, which may require liaison with industry partners to assist with the development of your design solutions.
Project documentation and presentation methods are expected to reflect independent thinking and communication of design ideas and concepts, supported by relevant practical and written research.
