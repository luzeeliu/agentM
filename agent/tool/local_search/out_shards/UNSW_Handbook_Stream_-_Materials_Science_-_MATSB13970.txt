Stream Outline
Materials Science/Engineering is a broad-ranging discipline which applies the principles of Science and Engineering to the development of metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials and to their manufacture into goods and their subsequent performance. It is founded on the relationship between structure and properties, an understanding of which permits materials to be engineered to specific end use requirements.
