We live through our digital devices: working, socialising, learning, consuming, creating. Of course, digital technology is constantly changing. If we speculate on the future, what can we imagine? What will our lifeworld be like in 10, 20, 50 or 100 years? In this course, you will learn and deploy production techniques to tell your own interactive speculative fiction. You will also learn to think critically about the important technical, social, economic and political roles technology plays in creating our world. As inspiration you will be exposed to critical scholarship alongside key works of speculative and science fiction. We will draw on a diverse range of theoretical and narrative approaches, and will engage in collaborative workshops aimed at creating scenarios, scenes, characters, events, environments and societies of the future. Technically and creatively, you will learn web-coding techniques that empower you to tell interactive stories in the browser, but no prior coding skills or knowledge are required. You will also pursue your own media authoring interests relevant to your project. What you will learn has applications in science and technology studies, critical media studies, creative arts, web design, interaction design, screenwriting, and more.
