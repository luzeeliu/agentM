This program is for students commencing from 2023.
The double degree program Bachelor of Design [BDes] Bachelor of Media [BMedia] is designed to provide you with the combination of foundational and applied skills, knowledge and capabilities in media and the skills and understanding in design. The program aims to develop communication leaders who are also highly skilled in using design methodologies in the production of graphic and other forms of visual communication. Both programs emphasise innovation, creativity, sustainability, and ethical practice.
Design/Media provides graduates with great opportunities to work across a wide range of communication disciplines and fields. Graduates will be particularly well suited to work in advertising, with both an understanding of advertising practice and a strong ability in graphic and other visual communication.
The BDes component will prepare the next generation of designers through our unique, flexible and wide-ranging specialisations including Integrated Design, Industrial Design and Computational Design. We invite you to craft a design career based on your goals, the needs of today, and the challenges we’ll face tomorrow, through innovative thinking, and design skills across a range of disciplines and materials.
The BMedia component is structured to equip you with expertise to make a difference in the exciting, challenging, and constantly evolving field of media. Media at UNSW pushes you to develop confidence in a diverse and flexible mix of creative, critical, and practical knowledges. You will gain essential skills for navigating media in the 21st century so that you can collaborate effectively, and drive and respond to innovation.
