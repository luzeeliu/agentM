With aviation continuing to experience unprecedented times as the industry recovers from COVID, the potential for terrorist and criminal activities involving the industry remains a possibility. The combination of these factors highlights the need for a focus on aviation security and related systems.
Aviation is a complex set of procedures and activities that when brought together results in a secure and efficient transport system. Any interruption to that system can and will have far reaching effects on public confidence and their expectations, government oversight, delays and costs to industry, and the potential for loss of live and suffering.
Aviation security as applied to airlines and airports must be risk based and outcomes focused. It must be tailored to the specifics of the airline or airport. Aviation security takes a layered approach to protecting an aircraft, passengers and crew. There is no one single measure that can be applied to mitigate the risk to zero. All risks must be identified and mitigated to an acceptable level. Aviation security is about reducing the risk whilst adding these elements to the aircraft.
This fully online, distance education course provides students with the opportunity to explore and evaluate contemporary security issues, aviation security standards and recommended practices, aviation security principles and procedures through case study-based learning and in a self-paced manner. The course will explore topics including the Australian regulatory environment, security in airports and airlines, risk and threat management, and security management systems. Students will also have the opportunity to test their understanding through assessments that draw on the concepts explored in the case studies.
