This course takes a considered look at the position elderly and aged people find themselves in in the legal system and aims to develop a theoretically informed competent legal practitioner. Ageism is a real phenomenon which plays out in significant ways in the legal system – in employment, in the medical arena, in housing, for Indigenous people etc. The following is a non-exhaustive list of issues:
Theories about ageing and older age, whether the term ‘elder law’ is appropriate because of different connotations in Indigenous societies
A human rights framework for dealing with ageing and the rights of older persons – national and international developments
The concept of ageism and how it plays out in the law
Ageism and age discrimination in employment
The right to housing for older persons – including the legal regimes for retirement villages, residential aged care homes and older persons living in the community
Right to health of older persons and the allocation of health system resources – access to treatment etc
Indigenous people in Australia and ageing
Elder abuse - affronts to dignity, the person, financial abuse, fraud etc
End of life decision-making – advance directives, enduring guardianship, enduring powers of attorney, executing a will; the ‘good death’
Discrimination law and older persons, including the intersection of older age with disability, gender and other statuses
Capacity, age and older persons - common law, statute, and international law
