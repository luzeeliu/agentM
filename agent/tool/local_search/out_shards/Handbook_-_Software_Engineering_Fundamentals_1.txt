This course teaches students about software engineering principles via exposure to the important practice of building correct products in effectively functioning teams.
Students will be exposed to agile software practices, team collaboration and effective communication through implementing a group project based on agile software methodologies that requires them to analyse, design, build and deploy a web-based application. This course is typically taken soon after completing DPST1091 but could be delayed and taken later. DPST1093 provides essential background for the teamwork and project management required in many later courses.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
