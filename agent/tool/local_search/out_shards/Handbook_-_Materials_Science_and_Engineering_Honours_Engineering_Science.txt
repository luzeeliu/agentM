This handbook entry is for students commencing their studies from 2024. Please refer to previous editions of the handbook for pre-2024 requirements.
This double degree program, taken over five years of full-time study, gives students the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge in two complementary areas: a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering, and a Bachelor of Engineering Science in Chemical Engineering or Nuclear Engineering. The School of Materials Science and Engineering administers the program, and the School of Chemical Engineering and School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering provides advice on their component of the program.
The broad objective of the program is to develop well-educated graduates who possess strong technical knowledge in these complementary disciplines, along with the necessary skills and attributes required to practice as professional engineers. The desired skills include the ability to be independent investigators, self-motivated individuals, critical thinkers, problem solvers, lifelong learners, effective communicators, team players, and efficient managers. Moreover, they are expected to demonstrate awareness of economic, environmental, and social issues.
The double degree program therefore provides students with a pathway to enhance their professional opportunities through developing these cross-disciplinary skills and knowledge. As such, graduates of the program find career opportunities diverse sectors, including advanced manufacturing, renewable energy, healthcare, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries, as well as careers in research and development, and entrepreneurship.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC.
Students are required to complete the following:
1. Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering - 168 UOC
2. Bachelor of Engineering Science - 96 UOC
Because of the overlap of at least 24 units of credit of engineering courses in both cores, the total units of credit required for completion is 240 UOC, rather than 264 UOC.

At least 24 UOC of these courses must be from Level 3 or above.
Course substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
3132 Materials Science and Engineering (Honours) / Engineering Science Specific Information
keyboard_arrow_down
1. Students may substitute up to 12 UOC of Advanced Disciplinary courses (Level 5) in place of Disciplinary Knowledge courses from a school specified stream list of courses with the approval of the Program or Stream Authority.
2. Only courses in the BE (Hons) in Materials Science and Engineering will count towards the honours calculation.
Enrolment Disclaimer
Please read the Double Degree Program rules as some specific rules apply to particular Double Degree combinations.
You are responsible for ensuring you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and advice from your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program.
