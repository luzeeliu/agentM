IDES2021 sensitizes industrial design students to be more mindful of their role and responsibility to human society and to the natural environment that nurtures society. It highlights how the design process can become more ethical and more responsive to social needs, and how design can empower individuals and groups to catalyse and realize positive change in the present and future of their communities. It broadens the social impact and influence of design beyond pure market orientation through the inclusion of marginalized and underrepresented user groups and through addressing significant issues affecting society such as crime, social injustice, disabilities, public safety, climate change, food security, extreme poverty, responsible consumption, equality, education access, refugees, and the developing world. Through online videos and in-class workshops, students will explore how design innovation can enrich the quality of life and wellbeing for all without sacrificing ecological sustainability or economic prosperity.
