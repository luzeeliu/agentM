Welcome to the Information Technology/Computer Science Project Course, where theory meets practice in a hands-on exploration of real-world projects. This course is designed to elevate your programming skills by immersing you in the intricacies of coding, debugging, and optimizing software solutions. As you apply your theoretical knowledge of information technology/computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures, you will actively bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. This course places a strong emphasis on teamwork and effective collaboration. You will navigate the challenges of group projects, learning to work seamlessly with peers, share responsibilities, and communicate ideas effectively. Beyond coding and collaboration, the course offers a comprehensive exploration of project management skills. From planning and scheduling to task prioritization, you will gain insights into the entire project lifecycle, experiencing firsthand the evolution of a concept into a completed solution. Furthermore, you will learn the art of crafting clear and concise project reports, and the skills to deliver impactful presentations.
You will work in teams of ideally five (5) members to define, implement and evaluate a real-world project. Project teams meet weekly starting from Week 1 with project mentors to report on the progress of the project. Assessment is based on a project proposal, progressive demonstrations and retrospectives, a final project demonstration and report, and on the quality of the software system itself. You will also get the chance to reflect on your own contributions and provide peer assessments of your team members.
