The Master of Information Technology/Master of Commerce double degree is ideal for you if you are an early or mid-career professional seeking to advance your career, or if you are a career-changer wanting to re-skill for a wide range of business and technology related roles.
The Master of Commerce is innovative, industry-relevant and incorporates the latest thinking in business. The Master of Information Technology provides a broad-based IT education, and more specialised knowledge in up to two areas, enabling you to work in a range of positions in the IT industry. Both components allow you to specialise, choosing from a range of disciplines, to pursue your career ambitions.
This program allows you to graduate with both Masters after three years, with students with advanced standing able to complete both degrees up to a year and a half sooner.
