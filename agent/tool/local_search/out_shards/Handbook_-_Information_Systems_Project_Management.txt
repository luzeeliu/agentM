This is an advanced (Level 3) Information Systems (IS) Course. This course aims to equip you with both theory and practical skills in the management of projects and programmes concerning the development and implementation of business solutions in the information systems context. The course will cover both predictive and adaptive approaches of project management used in contemporary organisations and will give students an exposure on fundamental components and plans for projects. This course is suitable for students who intend to be project managers as well as those who will work as part of a project team in contemporary organisations. The course aims to further develop you as a scholar and future business professional. The course will refine your communication skills and group-work skills, improve your time management and enhance your research skills. The course assumes no prior experience of project management but does assume that you have completed the IS core course INFS2603 Business Analysis and Agile Product Management.
Note: this course was previously offered as INFS2848. Students who have taken INFS2848 will not be able to enrol in this course.
