Description
This course focuses on the theoretical foundation of all the biological sciences -- the modern theory of evolution. Most of the course will be devoted to contemporary research questions and approaches including: evolutionary genetics, life-history evolution, evolutionary ecology, measuring selection, experimental evolution. Evolutionary analysis will be applied to important questions such as host-parasite coevolution of antibiotic resistance. The course will also explore hsitorical and philosophical aspects of evolutionary theory.
