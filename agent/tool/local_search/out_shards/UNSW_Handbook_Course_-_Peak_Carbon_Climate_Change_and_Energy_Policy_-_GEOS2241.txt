Description
Why are Australians among the world’s worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters? What has Australia done to reduce its contribution to global climate change compared to other nations, such as the US, UK and Germany? What are the major obstacles to be overcome before Australia can make deep cuts in greenhouse emissions, particularly from energy generation?
Exploring these and other key issues, Peak Carbon will give students a greater insight into one of the most important policy challenges confronting Australia and the world today.
