This course studies important works of modern and contemporary Chinese literature. It explores the development of Chinese poetry and fiction in the twentieth century and beyond. Authors we examine span across both geography and time. They include mainland Chinese and Taiwanese writers. You will be expected to read and analyse their works critically. You will develop understanding of the content, style and context of the literary texts in assessment tasks, and develop your ability to write clearly and analytically about literary works. The lecture and discussion will be in Chinese, but you can choose to read the original Chinese texts with translations, and to present and write in either Chinese or English.
