This program is for students commencing from 2023.
The three-year Bachelor of Media (BMedia) equips you with expertise to make a difference in the exciting, challenging, and constantly evolving field of media.
Media at UNSW pushes you to develop confidence in a diverse and flexible mix of creative, critical, and practical knowledges. You will gain essential skills for navigating media in the 21st century so that you can collaborate effectively, and drive and respond to innovation.
Studying Media at UNSW will immerse you in professional cultures, allow you to engage with emerging practices, and give you real-world experience working on real projects with real outcomes. It will also give you the intellectual tools to think critically about media and its vital role in the world today.
To build this expertise, you’ll choose between five specialisations: Cinema Studies; Communication and Journalism; Media Studies; Public Relations and Advertising; and Screen Production.
And no matter where you focus your studies, you can also take electives across other specialisations or opt to complete a Media Minor in a second specialisation. That flexibility means you’ll be ready for wherever the future takes you and your career in media.
