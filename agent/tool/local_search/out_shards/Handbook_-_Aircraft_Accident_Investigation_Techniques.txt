The investigation of aircraft incidents and accidents is now recognised as an essential component of an effective safety management system (SMS). By its very nature, an aircraft accident represents some form of failure of the aviation safety system. In many cases, valuable insights into the safety health of an organisation can be gained by the effective use of proven incident or accident investigation techniques. Such investigations are necessarily ‘reactive’ but do provide a valuable ‘snapshot’ of how flight operations, maintenance practices and general company management were being conducted at the time of the event. When combined with a ‘proactive’ incident reporting and investigation program (now components of a SMS), the often hidden factors that adversely influence the actions of operational personnel can be revealed.
This fully online course is intended to provide students with a general understanding of the processes of aircraft incident and accident investigation, in order to better understand the role of air safety investigation in the wider aviation safety management context.
The investigation techniques examined in this course are directed solely to the objective of accident prevention. The apportioning of blame or the determination of liability is not part of this process.
The units explored in the course will provide the basic building blocks for a system of investigation based on the International Standards and Recommended Practices, as described in Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, national investigation legislation, the ICAO Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation, and the ICAO Human Factors Training Manual.
This course is designed for those who have an interest in aviation, and a desire to improve or refresh their knowledge in this fascinating subject.

Notes
Moodle, on a distance-learning basis, allowing students to study at their own pace, in accordance with their particular work schedules and locations. It is expected that students need to spend 10 hours per week studying. Additional time may be required during the assessment submission period. Although the bulk of the course is self-paced, there is an expectation for students to submit their assessments by the specified due dates and according to instructions provided in the course.
During the course, there will be at least one on-line tutorial of 1-1.5 hours with the course facilitator to discuss the course topics and how they are applied in practice. This also gives students the opportunity to ask any questions from the course facilitator to assist their understanding of the subjects covered.
