This first-year (Level 1) introductory course in Materials Science and Engineering introduces students to the structure and properties of materials, highlighting their major positive impact on society, particularly in structural, biomedical, and transport applications.
The course commences with the factors influencing the microstructure of materials, and the impact of microstructure on the properties and performance of engineering materials (metals, ceramics, polymers and composites). The course then covers topics on the micromechanisms of elastic and plastic deformation, and fracture mechanisms for ductile and brittle materials. It also introduces students to phase equilibria and how temperature and composition affect the expected phases in a material, which are further understood with the use of phase diagrams.
Students will gain an insight into why materials science and engineering matters via interviews with academic staff in the school about their current research, and visits to major industrial materials companies in New South Wales. Introductory materials laboratories will allow students to test and characterise materials and analyse data related to material properties.
This is the introductory materials core course for students in the BE(Hons) (Materials Science and Engineering) program and the Materials Science Major of the BSc and BAdvSci(Hons) programs. Successful completion of the course is a requirement for some Level 2 materials courses in these programs.
The course content will be delivered through a series of standard and flipped lectures and tutorials.
A knowledge of high-school level chemistry and physics (NSW HSC Year 11 or equivalent) will provide a strong foundation for the course.
