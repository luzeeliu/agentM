This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The study of Politics and International Relations focuses on the workings of government and global politics, and will help you understand the most pressing challenges facing the world today, including political instability and conflict, security, great-power rivalry, climate change, development, human rights, governance and inequality. The solutions to many national and global problems are often intricately connected with regional and global processes, structures, mechanisms, forces, interests, customs and institutions. Knowing how to identify these solutions, their context and histories, is often challenging, frequently rewarding, and always interesting. A minor in Politics and International Relations will allow you to delve into the complex relationships between state and non-state actors, individuals and organisations in national and international contexts, and you will learn how to think critically about the nature of power in contemporary and historical perspective.
