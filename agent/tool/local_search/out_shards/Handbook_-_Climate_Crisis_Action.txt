This course explores ways contemporary societies are proactively responding to fossil fuelled climate disruption and examines critical and creative ways these responses can be strengthened. In this course, after learning about scientific knowledges of climate disruption, you will investigate efforts both to reduce greenhouse gases (mitigation) and to help communities become more resilient to the impacts of a hotter planet (adaptation). Informed by theories of climate justice, the course enables you to critically analyse existing forms of climate action and provides opportunities to engage with, design, and implement arts-based, community-led, decolonising, and other creative, innovative, and novel efforts to reduce emissions and their effects. You will explore efforts at local, national, and international scales, including those of communities, governments, and businesses, and consider examples from around the world. The course includes a significant student-led component designed to increase students' capabilities as leaders for climate justice.
