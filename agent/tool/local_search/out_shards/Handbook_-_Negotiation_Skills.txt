Negotiation Skills aims to empower students with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills necessary to effectively negotiate within personal and professional contexts, emphasising the development of critical thinking, persuasive communication, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities. Students will learn how to identify interests, build rapport, create value, assess power dynamics, manage conflict, and cultivate productive interpersonal relationships to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. The course includes various activities, such as role plays, where students will gain hands-on experience to practice and refine their approach to negotiations in a supportive learning environment. By the end of the course, students will have developed a comprehensive negotiation toolkit tailored to their individual strengths that can be applied across diverse professional contexts with confidence and professionalism.
Join us in this transformative journey to enhance your negotiation prowess, unlock new opportunities, and positively impact your personal and professional life.
