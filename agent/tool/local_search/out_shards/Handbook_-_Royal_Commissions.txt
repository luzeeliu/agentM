Royal Commissions have the power to shape national conversations, call the powerful to account and drive legislative and regulatory change. This course examines the powers, processes and effectiveness of Royal Commissions and builds on core concepts from the LLB and JD programs.
Students will examine the legislative frameworks underpinning Royal Commissions in Australia and understand the roles played by legal practitioners in various aspects of the operation of a Royal Commission. Drawing insights from notable inquiries, such as those into the banking and financial services industry, Robodebt, disability, aged care quality and safety, institutional responses to child sexual abuse, and Aboriginal deaths in custody, students will evaluate the social, political, legislative, and regulatory contexts and impacts of Royal Commissions.
Students will be equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to engage with Royal Commissions professionally and be capable of offering informed and strategic advice in areas of national interest.
