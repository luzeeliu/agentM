The goal of this subject is to teach you about the strategic management of technology and innovation from a general manager’s perspective. This subject views technology, broadly defined, as the process by which an organisation transforms all of its organisational inputs (i.e., labour, capital, materials, and information - NOT just ITC) into products and/or services.  Innovation is defined as a significant change in an organisation’s underlying technology.  Because technology is a critical resource for each organisation, it must be managed by the general manager for comparative advantage.  To do so necessitates aligning the technology strategy with the business strategy of the firm. Attention will be focused upon the major theoretical and empirical contributions to the field and their implications for practitioners.  Experiential work and case studies will be used to assist you in relating the content material to your own experience and practice. When you have completed this subject, you will be expected to have: 1) A working understanding of the concepts and techniques of strategy technology management; 2) An ability to critically analyse the behaviour or organizations and organisational members in developing, implementing, and managing technology from a strategic perspective; and 3) The capacity to critically evaluate the strategic management of technology within diversified companies.
