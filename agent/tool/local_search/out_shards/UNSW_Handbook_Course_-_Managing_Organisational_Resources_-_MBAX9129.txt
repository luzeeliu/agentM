Description
The course aims to provide a performance management framework for managing major types of enterprise resources. A total enterprise perspective is employed, positioning the organisation in its value creation system. The nature of the resources to be managed and their relative importance is examined, as well as the management issues related to and appropriate performance measurement techniques available for assessing each type of resource. An enterprise governance framework is used to guide the process by linking resource management to the performance of strategy, risk management, corporate ethics and ethos, corporate governance structures and processes, and social and environmental responsibility.
