The Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences (Honours) is a 48 UOC (one year equivalent) advanced undergraduate degree for high achieving students which may be taken upon completion of an undergraduate pass degree in Arts, Social Sciences, PPE, International Studies or Social Research and Policy. A student undertaking this program will normally complete honours within their chosen major specialisation of study in their pass degree. The focus of Honours year is on the further development of analytical and research skills, deepening of knowledge, and application of methods that are specific to students' chosen (major) discipline of study. The BASS (Hons) may be completed full-time or part-time.
The aims of the BASS (Hons) are:
To further develop the disciplinary skills acquired by students in their major specialisation of study (AQF Level 7). In particular, to inculcate higher-order research skills in critical thinking, reflection and analysis.
To understand relevant disciplinary methods and approaches and their assumptions, and to apply them in research.
To deepen disciplinary-specific knowledge and to understand its theoretical frameworks and contexts of application. To apply such knowledge while considering, where appropriate, interdisciplinary perspectives, historical and comparative frameworks, and world-views of other times, places, and cultures.
To appreciate the place of ethics in private and public life and to interrogate disciplinary frameworks, assumptions and processes in light of ethical values.
