Strategic Planning interrogates the practical, applied nature of the discipline through a conceptual and theoretical and critical lens. A major characteristic of strategic planning as a practice is the synthesis of diverse information and analysis, alongside community and stakeholder opinion into communicable planning documents. In this course you will explore the key drivers of change within our cities, for example housing supply and affordability, urban renewal, urban justice, infrastructure and climate change. You will explore the tensions that shape how decisions get made - or not - through the complex lens of urban governance and how planning - and planners - engage with those we plan for. As planners we are interested in the inherently spatial dimensions of these urban processes, recognising that collective efforts to influence land use change and behaviours of urban stakeholders take place at different geographical scales, and impact on different groups in different ways. This course focuses on the metropolitan and regional scale, where the conditions requiring strategic planning are arguably most evident.
