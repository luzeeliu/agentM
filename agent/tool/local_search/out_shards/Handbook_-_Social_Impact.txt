COMM5701 Social Impact
is the core course in the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact and the MBAX (Social Impact) programs. It is highly recommended that students take COMM5701 either as their first Social Impact course (or one of the courses in their first study session that includes Social Impact courses).
The course is an introduction to Social Impact covering fundamental concepts and key developments in what has become a complex social purpose eco-system. The course introduces an understanding of changes across what was formerly seen as a distinct social sector to examine the cross-sectoral social purpose developments that includes traditional organisational structures of Charities and Not For-Profits, Business and Government, and new and emerging ‘hybrid’ structures and programs, including social enterprises. Key concepts include: systems thinking and mapping, measuring impact, funding and investing in impact, organisational challenges including scaling, strategy, hybridity, and leadership for social impact. The course explores how intractable social, economic, and environmental problems embedded in society are being addressed through social innovation in business entrepreneurship, enterprises and cross-sector collaboration.
