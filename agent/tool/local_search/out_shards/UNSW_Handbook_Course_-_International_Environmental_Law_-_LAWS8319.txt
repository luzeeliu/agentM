Description
This course will provide students with an overview of the development of international environmental law throughout the twentieth century as well as the major theoretical and policy debates that surround it. Attention will primarily be devoted to the international legal responses to global and regional environmental and resource management issues. Basic principles will be discussed prior to taking a sectoral approach in looking at the application of international environmental law in certain specific issue areas. The course does not have an Australian focus. Rather, focus will be international legal and policy responses adopted to deal with environmental problems in an international and transboundary context.
This course is also available to students enrolled in the
Master of Environmental Management
(8619),
Graduate Diploma in Environmental Management
(5499) and the
Graduate Certificate in Environmental Management
