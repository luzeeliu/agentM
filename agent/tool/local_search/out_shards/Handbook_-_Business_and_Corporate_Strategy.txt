This course introduces you to the skills necessary to be a successful strategy consultant or a general manager of an established firm or new business venture. Strategy is less about day-to-day operations of the firm and more about positioning the firm, articulating its vision, and designing the firm to achieve competitive advantage. As such, this course provides a detailed excursion into the latest developments in the theory and practice of strategic thinking and strategic management. It examines how organisations in different industries choose their vision and goals, strategically position themselves, and develop firm-specific capabilities to achieve and sustain competitive advantage (success). Our focus will be on enhancing our “strategic thinking” skills by critically reflecting on issues such as shareholder value, environmental-social-governance pillars, and long-term vs short-term horizons.
