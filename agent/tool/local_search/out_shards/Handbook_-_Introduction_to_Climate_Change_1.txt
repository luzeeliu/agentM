Why do people disagree so much about climate change? How can they tell fact from fiction in the debate? How do they know climate change is happening and what are the causes? Climate change is now an issue confronting many disciplines, from architecture, engineering and business through to environmental science, public health, law and economics. This online course will draw on a broad collection of UNSW experts to cover the basics of climate change science, as well as a selection of key related areas from psychology, law, politics, economics, energy supply, ethics and health. A range of perspectives on the nature of these challenges will be treated with a critical analysis approach, as well as hands-on engagement with the peer review process, highlighting its role in the scientific process.
This course is an online-only offering and therefore there are no physical attendance requirements. There are no pre-requisites and so this course suits students at any stage of their degree. Lectures are asynchronous. However, the course requires regular and consistent online participation including online group work with other students. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with the course documentation and spend around 6 hours per week on the course. This includes going through lesson content in a timely manner, participating in group work activities, contributing to online discussion forums, and submitting assessments.
