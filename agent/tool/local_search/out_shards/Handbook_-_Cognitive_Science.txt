This course will provide students with an advanced-level understanding of theories, methods and controversies in four key areas of cognitive psychology: 1) Judgment and Decision-making; 2) Categorisation and Reasoning; 3) Theory, Models and Context; and (4) Intelligence and Thinking. As part of the course, students will develop a Research Proposal that investigates a novel issue in cognitive science.
This course is intended for students who are interested in cognitive science. Lectures are delivered in person and recorded for revision purposes. Most of the in-person tutorials are in support of the Research Proposal: students will work in groups to develop and present a proposal. Other tutorials will provide an opportunity for in-depth discussion of course topics. The course also features two short online modules that pursue questions raised in the lectures.
