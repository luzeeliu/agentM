Description
The social sciences play an integral role in comprehensive environmental management, and their importance has been recognised in recent years. This course explains the social, political and historical contexts of organisational and theoretical frameworks within which environmental issues are interpreted and decision making occurs. You will investigate the role of science and the influence of technological change on both environmental impacts and environmental management. The course uses case studies of important environmental issues to explore social science methods and provide an overview of the contributions made by a range of disciplinary areas.
