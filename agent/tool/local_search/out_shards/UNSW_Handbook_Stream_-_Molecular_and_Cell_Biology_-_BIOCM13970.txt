Stream Outline
Recent advances in Molecular Cellular Biology, especially the continuing development of recombinant DNA technology, have revolutionised our understanding of the structure, function and regulation of individual genes. These advances have opened up the exciting field of Molecular Biology, one of the most rapid growth areas in biology. This marriage of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Cell Biology provides an exciting new approach for the study of all living organisms, including the human. Molecular Biology therefore represents fundamental components of biological and medical science and they will have increasingly important roles to play in many aspects of modern medicine, genetics, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, biotechnology and genomics.
