In this course we will undertake an examination of a range of anti-terrorism laws from around the world, emphasising those enacted since the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001.

The jurisdictions which will receive particular focus are those of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. However, some other countries such as Indonesia, India and the United States may usefully be considered at various stages.
