Description
The goal of this course is to enable students to write an environmental management project paper based on material gathered during the Environmental Management Research Internship (IEST5004) and it is clearly related to the subject matter covered in this course. The course does not maintain regularly scheduled classes. However students are required to participate in oral presentations on the project papers at the end of the term. Informal meetings may be convened periodically with the course coordinator so that general discussions about the preparations for the paper and the oral presentation can be held, and progress in research informally assessed. Throughout the term of the project students will be working with the course coordinator and academic advisor(s) who will review progress in preparing the final project paper document.
This course is available by distance study.
