The
Graduate Diploma in Aviation Management
(GradDipAvMgmt) is a 48 UoC program of study designed to provide professionals with the skills and knowledge to be effective in a contemporary aviation environment. Prospective students do not need to hold a University degree to enrol in the GradDipAvMgmt, but must have a minimum of one (1) year of relevant industry experience. Evidence of industry experience will need to be provided upon application and will be reviewed by the School of Aviation to determine its relevance for program entry.
Students with appropriate education and/or professional experience may be eligible for advanced standing and may then complete the degree in less time. Eligibility for advanced standing is determined by the School of Aviation on a case-by-case basis. Prospective students are encouraged to contact the School for more information on eligibility criteria.
The GradDipAvMgmt is offered entirely through distance education. The online courses are delivered through a secure learning and teaching website, with the core component of learning delivered in a self-paced, asynchronous format. Students do not need to attend any on-campus activities, but there will be opportunities to engage in scheduled and online, synchronous consultations and skills-focused workshops.
The program has been developed by aviation industry and aviation experts with the aim of supporting students to develop a holistic aviation skill set. The curriculum includes courses that explore the areas of airline and airport operations, airline corporate management, law and regulation, security, human factors, flight data analytics and accident investigation.
The program is 48 units of credit (or 1 year full-time equivalent) and can be taken on a full-time or part-time basis. Students with full-time employment are recommended to undertake a part-time study load.
Please note: This program is also a pathway for professionals without an undergraduate qualification to study the Master of Aviation Management (8741).
Students who have completed the GradDipAvMan with a WAM of >65 will receive 48 UoC advanced standing towards the Master of Aviation Management.
