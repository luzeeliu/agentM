Description
Extends on the teachings of ANAT2111 and ANAT2511 and complements the other level III anatomy courses (ANAT3131, ANAT3141 and ANAT3411) by providing detailed information regarding the viscera and associated musculoskeletal structure of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. The course aims at providing students with sound knowledge of the structure and, to a lesser degree, the function of the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, reproductive, lymphatic and autonomic nervous systems. Lectures focus on the structure and function of the viscera as well as clinical cases and surface anatomy, while the laboratory classes involve the study of wet and plastinated prosected specimens, cross-sectional images and radiographs. Assessment consists of two practical exams and a theory exam and this course can be used towards obtaining a major in Anatomy.
