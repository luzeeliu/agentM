Become a highly regarded and trusted tax advisor to businesses and investors. Individuals and entities undertaking business and investment decisions require professional advice to make the most tax-effective decisions.
This course is the starting point for building your expertise in tax law. You will deal with real world facts and problems confronted by businesspeople and their tax advisors, which require solutions through the application of tax law. You will develop analytical skills in identifying and then applying the tax law to diverse commercial and investment transactions.
You will focus on the taxation of key transactions, the taxation of key entities, the role of the tax regulator (Australian Taxation Office), and the obligations of tax agents. Key elements of fringe benefits tax, goods and services tax, the anti-avoidance rules, and superannuation. International tax is also covered.
The course is a core course in the taxation major in the Bachelor of Commerce, and an elective course for other majors. The course satisfies accreditation requirements of the professional accounting bodies (e.g. CPA Australia, CAANZ, IPA). It also satisfies the educational eligibility requirement for registration as a tax agent under the Tax Practitioners Board guideline for one of the two courses in taxation law.
