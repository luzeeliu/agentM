This course covers aspects of both the physical and biological environments of the sea and their inter-relationships. It depicts marine science as a body of knowledge and a process of continual enquiry and testing of ideas. It considers human impacts on the marine environment and how the principles and methods of science in general are used to predict and to solve the problems created by human activities.
The course includes discussion of: i) the marine environment, its physical, geological, chemical and biological characteristics, and their interactions; ii) beach safety and marine biodiversity; and iii) the effects of development and climate change on the marine environment and how science can contribute to providing solutions to these problems. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on case studies. The course is delivered in intensive mode over 4 weeks and involves one field excursion (timed to coincide with the low tide), weekly practical classes and tutorials supplemented with online lectures. Field trips will incur no additional/personal costs.
