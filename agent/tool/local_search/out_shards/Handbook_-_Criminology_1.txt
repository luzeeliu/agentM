Criminology is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the study of crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Over the past 50 years, criminology has evolved into a rich, broad-based discipline, no longer narrowly focused on crime and punishment. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, insurance, policing, governance and regulation. Criminology is shaped not only by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, but also those in history, politics, economics, architecture, cultural studies, and other interdisciplinary fields.
The major stream in Criminology will provide you with an advanced understanding of crime and justice issues in contemporary society. At UNSW we use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates disciplinary knowledge from Sociology, Psychology, History, Law and Policy Studies, to provide a critical and theoretically informed understanding of crime and the justice system, criminal law and procedures, criminological research methods, as well as a range of current issues with respect to social control, juvenile justice, human rights, regulation, and penal policy. A major stream in Criminology pairs well with a minor stream in Politics and International Relations or Sociology and Anthropology.
