Description
In Australia, one in two males and one in three females will develop cancer by the age of 85, and nearly one in three Australians will die from that disease. Students undertaking PATH3206 Cancer Pathology will learn about the five most common cancers in Australia; carcinoma of the skin, prostate, large bowel, breast and lung, as well as cancers of the cervix, stomach and blood. Students will gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of these cancers, as well as their macroscopic, microscopic and clinical features.
