It is safe to say big data has become mainstream. Industry is forging ahead in the use of data mining to uncover patterns and information from massive datasets and reap the associated rewards. However, the challenges are not simply an increase in the size of datasets, but that of understanding the nature of the data being collected, the processes that underpin this data and the structure inherent in the data. In order to incorporate these aspects in the practice of data analyses, it is critical to bring techniques for signal analyses, filtering and dynamic modelling to bear on the problems and develop appropriate frameworks within which predictive systems can be engineered. These techniques from the fields of signal processing and control systems are traditionally learnt by Electrical Engineers and this course will give you a fairly unique perspective into the principles of Data Science from this perspective. In addition, in this course you will be able to apply your knowledge of signal processing, control, modelling, mathematics and computing to the practice of data modelling and machine learning.
