How is heat transferred between objects? What are the challenges of supersonic flight, and how are rockets designed? These are some of the questions you will be able to answer after this course.
Welcome to ‘Advanced Thermofluids’, which aims to further develop your foundational knowledge introduced in your Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics courses. This course will cover the main modes of heat transfer, conduction, convection, and radiation. Knowledge of these areas will be applied to heat exchanger and cooling fin design through both theory and experiments. We will explore the fluid dynamics of high-speed compressible flows and shock waves. Finally, non-reacting gas mixtures/combustion and their energy release will be discussed. We will delve into how these topics play a role in our everyday lives and are linked with many facets of Engineering roles in industry.
The topics covered will prepare students for later electives within their programs and to raise a fundamental awareness of these fields for those who do not take the elective extension subjects later in their program.
