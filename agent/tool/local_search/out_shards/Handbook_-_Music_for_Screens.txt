Drawing on examples from the silent era through to the present day—and with an international scope—this course offers you the opportunity to study the relationship between music and visual media from historical, critical, and technical perspectives, developing your understanding of the role composers for film, television, games, and other digital platforms play in shaping the narrative of a work.
