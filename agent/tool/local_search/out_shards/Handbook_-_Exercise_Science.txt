This program meets the requirements of Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA) for accreditation (pending) as an an exercise scientist (AES). In this program. you will gain an in-depth understanding of the function of the human body by studying anatomy and physiology in depth. You will also gain a broad knowledge of the exercise science subdisciplines including biomechanics, motor control, exercise prescription and delivery, exercise physiology, and health psychology. Throughout the program you will be immersed in professional placement (Work integrated learning; WIL) experiences, providing fundamental real-world skills. In the 3rd year of the program, one entire course will be dedicated to professional experience in exercise science. To complete this degree, you must complete 3 years equivalent of full-time study, including 140 hours of professional placement.
This program is only available as part of the integrated Bachelor of Exercise Science / Master of Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology double-degree (3896) and is not offered as a separate standalone program for direct entry.

CPR, First Aid and Hand Hygiene training
There are many different stakeholders involved in this degree, including the NSW Government, public and private hospitals and community practices, each with their own policies/procedures and all medical students must comply with NSW Health requirements before commencing clinical/hospital placements. Because health students will be accessing various health facilities, it is very important they are familiar with NSW Health policies.
NSW Health require all students to complete mandatory online training modules when commencing a clinical placement. Students who fail to satisfy the compliance requirements of NSW Health may be excluded from undertaking a clinical placement. Students are responsible for obtaining the required documents and vaccinations needed to meet compliance requirements and to attend compliance checks for verification.
Compulsory Training Component
Clinical and other workplace observations and simulation training will be undertaken regularly throughout this program to prepare you for your advanced WIL experiences.
Progression Requirements
Students are permitted to attempt the same course a maximum of three times. A student who fails the same course for the third time will not be permitted to re-enrol.
