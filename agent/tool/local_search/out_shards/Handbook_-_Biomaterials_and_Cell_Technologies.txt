Have you ever wondered how cochlear implants use platinum to restore hearing in profoundly deaf people, or how prosthetic hips made of titanium can replace bone and restore movement? Or how injured nerves have been treated with nerve grafts fabricated from artificial or natural polymers? This course will take you on a journey into the fascinating world of biomedical engineering, where you’ll discover the crucial role of materials in innovative medical technologies.
This course offers a blend of theory and practice. Through engaging lectures and interactive workshops, you’ll explore the diverse properties of materials vital for medical applications, covering biology, mechanics, chemistry, and electricity. You’ll also learn how biological cells and cutting-edge tests can assist in screening and validating material selection for medical applications.
The curriculum is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of material science, mechanical testing, and cellular biology. It will equip you with the skills needed to navigate the complexities of biomaterials and cellular methodologies. Whether you’re investigating the biocompatibility of new materials or interpreting cellular responses to medical devices, this interdisciplinary course will sharpen your skills and prepare you for a career in biomedical engineering.
This course serves as the foundation for more specialised courses aimed at understanding, designing and evaluating the biological and mechanical performance of materials used in medical devices.
