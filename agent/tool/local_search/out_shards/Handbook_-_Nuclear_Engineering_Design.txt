Nuclear Engineering Design is a capstone course in the Nuclear Engineering Honours specialistion which gives students an opportunity to integrate their knowledge and nuclear engineering skills from preceding courses to design a nuclear fission reactor. Working in small groups, students divide the key elements of reactor design - reactor physics, thermal hydraulics and nuclear materials – among team members and produce a combined design report, backed up by individual reports on the rationale for design choices in their area of specialization. Various offerings of the course have targeted reactor designs for powering space missions, naval propulsion, and small and modular microreactor designs for disaster response and remote power systems, such as mines and forward operating army base. Students are assisted by the detailed functional requirements specification for the reactor design, provided in week one, lectures on key topics, and guidance from teaching staff specialized in each of the three topic areas. The assessments encourage students to self-evaluate justify their design choices, leading to technical contestability as an important outcome.
