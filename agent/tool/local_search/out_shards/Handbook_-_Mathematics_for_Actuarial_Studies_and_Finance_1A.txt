This course, together with MATH1251, provides the mathematical foundation needed for Actuarial Studies and related disciplines, as well as possible further studies in mathematics and statistics. MATH1151 builds on high school level calculus, focussing first on a more rigorous development of limits and continuous and differentiable functions, and then introduces multivariable calculus with partial derivatives, tangent planes and multivariable chain rules.  The Riemann Integral is linked to differential calculus though the fundamental theorem of calculus and techniques of numerical integration are introduced. Vectors and vector geometry are further developed from high school and matrix algebra introduced.  Linear equations are treated with Gaussian elimination and matrix methods, and these are used for applications such as basic input-output linear models and least squares approximation. Discrete and continuous random variables are studied including the central limit theorem.  Matlab is used throughout MATH1151.
Assumed knowledge: HSC Mathematics Extension 1. Students will be expected to have achieved a combined mark of at least 140 in HSC Mathematics Advanced and HSC Mathematics Extension 1 or a combined mark of 175 in HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and Extension 2.
