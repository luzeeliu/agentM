Medical devices can help people hear again, feel again, walk again. Do you want to participate in the process of finding the materials that are used to make medical devices? Hearing implants use platinum to return hearing sensation in profoundly deaf people, prosthetic hips made of titanium can replace bone and restore movement, and severed nerves can be restored with nerve grafts fabricated from artificial or natural polymers. How were these biomaterials considered for these medical applications?
Engineering novel biomaterials is the essence behind the success of medical devices, yet not understanding the importance of biomaterials can result in health complication, even death. This requires evaluating biological, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties of materials and their role in the performance of medical devices? Embark on an exploration into the realm of biomedical engineering with this course, where theory meets hands-on application. Discover the intricate role of materials in groundbreaking medical technologies.
You will engage in experiential learning, bridging theory with practice. Through lectures and workshops, you will delve into the multifaceted properties of materials essential for medical applications, spanning biology, mechanics, chemistry, and electricity. In addition, the exploration of material performance relies on biological cells to better evaluate these properties. So, roll up your sleeves for hands-on experiences. Through laboratory experiments, you will learn how biological cells and front-line tests can help screen and validate material selection for medical applications.
The curriculum is crafted to integrate material science, mechanical testing, and cellular biology. It will equip you with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of biomaterials and cellular methodologies. Whether you are exploring the biocompatibility of new materials or deciphering cellular responses to medical devices, this interdisciplinary journey will hone your abilities and prepare you for the forefront of biomedical engineering.
This course is highly recommended for students without a background in materials science or cell biology. Students from these disciplines will gain first-hand experience in evaluating biomaterials for medical applications and interpreting cellular responses to medical devices. Conversely, students with backgrounds in materials science or cell biology will deepen their expertise through advanced discussions and practical applications tailored to biomedical contexts. Overall, this course caters to a diverse cohort of engineering students, ensuring that all participants emerge equipped with skills to contribute meaningfully to the interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering.
This course serves as a gateway to more specialised courses aimed at understanding, designing and evaluating the biological and mechanical performance of materials used in medical devices.
