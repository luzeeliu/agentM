Microscopic life pervades every aspect of our lives, influencing our health, diet, and environment. In this course, students will gain an appreciation of the diverse roles that microbes play in our everyday lives. The course starts with a general introduction to microbiology that will discuss cell structure and function, physiology, diversity and phylogeny. The course then focuses on introducing students to specific areas of microbiology: environmental microbiology including metabolism, microbial communities and archaea; microbes and synthetic biology; and, medical microbiology including bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens, as well as food-borne pathogens.
The lecture program is complemented by laboratory practicals where students will learn how to cultivate, identify, and utilise microbes. During this course, students will isolate and characterise a microbe from a sample of their choice. Students will use both traditional approaches and DNA sequencing technologies to identify the microorganisms in their sample.
Tutorial sessions reinforce concepts and skills from the lectures and practical sessions and support the development of groupwork and communication skills.
By the end of the course, students will have a broad appreciation of how the unseen microbes all around us influence us every day.
