.
The Master of Journalism and Communication (MJC) provides its graduates with a professionally relevant and academically rigorous education in journalism, media and communication. Students will acquire a portfolio of skills in media practice, equipping them for work in print, radio, television and online media, and in the media relations and corporate communication sectors. Students will develop a knowledge of the social, economic and political role of media in Australia and internationally, and will gain an understanding of the evolving nature of the convergent media landscape. They will also develop critical thinking and research skills, equipping them for practice as ethical, critically reflective media professionals. Course content draws on the work of international scholarship on journalism, media and communication, and students are encouraged to reflect on varied international approaches to media and communication practice.
The specialist knowledge and professional skills taught in this program are framed by an interdisciplinary inquiry into the social, cultural, economic and political role of journalism, media and communication, on a local and global level. Students are encouraged to think critically about media practice and production, and to develop a capacity for reflective and ethical decision making. Students learn in a range of settings including seminars, lectures, tutorials, intensive workshops and online learning environments. Emphasis is placed on independent problem solving, and assessments supporting this approach include both formative and summative components. Graduates will have an advanced knowledge of the field of contemporary journalism, communication and/or media studies; and will be able to apply this knowledge to their media, communication and journalism practice in different contexts and settings.
There is an emphasis on the research/teaching nexus, and students are encouraged to apply insights from contemporary media scholarship to current and evolving issues in media technology, ethics and practice. Community engagement is promoted both within the theoretical content of the courses, and within assessment tasks that may involve cooperative partnership with NGOs and industry organisations. Students will also be able to choose either or both the research or/and practice pathways at the Advanced Disciplinary level.
