This course is designed to introduce students to integrated marketing communications (IMC), with a focus on issues related to advertising and promotions management. It aims at relating the elements of the marketing mix (4Ps) to the various aspects of communications that take place between the firm and its customers. At the same time, this course lends itself to studying both “applied” and “theoretical” issues to give students both a real-world view of advertising and promotions, as well as frameworks for understanding such real-world decisions. An integrated approach is adopted, including an understanding of the role of media advertising and promotions. The course builds on knowledge of consumer behaviour and the analytical skills of marketing research.
It is highly recommended to take MARK2012 before taking this course, which equips you with important knowledge necessary to understand and develop advertising and promotions strategies in MARK2053.
