Are you interested in learning about how business leaders embed responsible decision making throughout an organisation? How they lead managers, staff and others across their value chain to not only deliver financial outcomes, but also sustainable business outcomes that deliver positive returns over time to all key stakeholders, including society and the environment.  Do you want to work in investment banking, as an executive at a major corporate, join a consulting firm or start your own business? Do you have a passion for both business and sustainability and having a positive impact on society and the environment? This course will help you understand how business leaders are driving change across their organisations to ensure all key decisions more effectively consider the broader impact of potential outcomes on all important resources and relationships before taking action to deliver the most sustainable outcomes over time.
Most importantly, through real world examples and worked case studies, you will be asked questions to assist you in making more responsible business decisions. You will also learn about the importance of intangibles to business value and understand how these together with ESG matters, are being identified, managed and reported on by quality 21st century organisations.
