Are Invertebrates Saving The World?
Over the ten weeks of BIOS2031 students will learn about the value
of invertebrates in nature. In the course students will learn about how and why invertebrates are critical to the natural world and the role of invertebrates in life on earth.
On completing the course, students
will have the knowledge to
recognize locations, habitats, and scales at which invertebrates occur and have experience in communicating the diversity and the role of invertebrate life.
You will have learned how
to find, assess, and identify
invertebrates in nature (terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems).
You will hear from academic and industry experts
about how environmental monitoring programs study invertebrates, and what is needed to interpret invertebrate ecology and biology as a function of healthy ecosystems.
Some compelling challenges
that professional invertebrate biologists are working to answer include;
Will there be enough food in the future for everyone?
When is environmental repair/rehabilitation/restoration finished?
Are we losing species before we know what/who they are?
How healthy are our natural environments?
How can understanding invertebrate biology help save lives?
In completing BIOS031 Biology of Invertebrates
students will have an understanding of the diversity of invertebrates, the biology of invertebrates , and the critical role that invertebrates play in the future of life on earth. Students will gain hands-on experience in Invertebrate Biology through weekly practicals and a 2-day field trip undertaken in week 6 at Chowder Bay in Sydney.
