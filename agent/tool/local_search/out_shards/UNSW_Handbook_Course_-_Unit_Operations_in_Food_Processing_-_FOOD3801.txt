Description
The principles introduced in FOOD1360 and FOOD1370 are used in studying some of the more important unit operations in the food industry.  The procedure used for each unit operation is to firstly describe the process, its applications, effects on the food product and requirements, appropriate process diagrams, mass and heat balances and flows, solving unit operation problems.  Unit operations covered are refrigeration, dehydration, evaporation, extrusion, physical separation and comminution.
