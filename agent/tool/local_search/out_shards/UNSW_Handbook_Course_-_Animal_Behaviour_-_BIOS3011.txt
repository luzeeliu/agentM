Description
Theory and practice in the biological study of animal behaviour: ethology and behavioural ecology. The observation and description of behaviour along with the development, function and evolution of behaviour in an ecological context are examined as important elements in the analysis of behaviour, particularly social behaviour. Topics include  sensory control systems, foraging behaviour, communication, home range, territorial behaviour, aggression and dominance, sexual behaviour, mate choice, mating systems, play and social organisation. Examples are drawn from the Australian fauna and both field and laboratory work are included.
Assumed Knowledge: Animal systematics and morphology with BIOS2031 or BIOS2061 recommended
