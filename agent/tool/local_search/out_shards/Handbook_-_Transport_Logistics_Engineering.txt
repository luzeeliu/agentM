This course will cover the basics of logistics data analytics, simulation, optimisation and operation research models, which are critical tools to solve complex decision-making problems arising in the field of freight transport and logistics. These advanced methods will be then used to create engineering solutions to manage existing logistical systems as well as answer questions on freight transport infrastructure needs. Throughout the course, these techniques will be illustrated on challenging transport and logistics problems such as port operations, resilient supply chain network design, facility location, vehicle routing, demand prediction as well as emerging information management systems in logistics and supply chains such as blockchain. After completing this course, students will have been exposed to efficient methods and their application to solve transport and logistics decision-making problems. The course will use real data for a course project as well as invite leading practitioners to present their expertise on selected topics.
