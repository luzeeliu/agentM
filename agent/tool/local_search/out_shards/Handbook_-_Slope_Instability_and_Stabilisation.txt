Analysis of slope instability and stabilisation is an important role for geotechnical engineers, engineering geologists, and mining engineers. This course will build on your knowledge of soil and rock mechanics in relation to slopes.
Topics include: Landslide classification and recognition; relation to topography and geology. Site investigations for
landslides – the specific issues. Analysis of stability; selection of shear strengths, shear strength of
fissured clays; review of limit equilibrium analysis, back-analysis; slope stabilisation, pre-failure
deformations of soil slopes. Slope stabilisation techniques including geometry change, control of
piezometric pressures, anchoring, retaining walls, reinforced soil. Pre- and post-failure deformations of excavated rock slopes. Stability analysis involving unsaturated soils. Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA), including assessment of the probability of failure, travel distance, risk estimation and risk acceptance criteria.
