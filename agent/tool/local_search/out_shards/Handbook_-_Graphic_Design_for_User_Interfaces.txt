Note: The code for this course was previously SDES9762.
This course will take you through processes of researching, planning and designing the architecture of a user interface. You will learn how the visual design of interfaces directly relates to the way users interact and experience them, ultimately determining their effectiveness and functionality.
Assessment tasks require you to plan and apply your existing visual communication skills to the graphic design of interfaces. By the end of the course you will have completed the graphic design of an user interface, and have the conceptual and practical skills, and confidence, to develop further interface designs.
Knowledge and skills in graphic design processes are required before enrolling in this course. You will need at least a basic understanding of Adobe Photoshop or equivalent.
