Global financial markets are a battlefield of mathematics, data, algorithms and AI. How would you even think about entering this theatre of information to make your mark with a successful trading strategy? This course will be taught in partnership with Optiver, the largest global options market maker in the world. Through a hands-on trading-floor style approach, we will show you how to build competitive trading strategies from scratch. We will start by showing you how to select, process and synthesise key information into signals that will transform your understanding of how financial markets operate. From this, you will infuse your insights with mathematics to propose and create your own trading strategies. Finally, you will learn how to convert your strategies into algorithms for deployment against your fellow students on a live virtual marketplace.
