From dancing robots to smartphone theatres, this course examines the shifting relationship between technology and performance cultures. It considers the expanding field of digital culture and how its applications have transformed the parameters of performance and representation. You will observe a range of performance objects, activities, events and behaviours produced in the exchange between the body and new media. You will draw on leading examples to develop your own live experiments across platforms that use Twitter, mobile media, surveillance and YouTube. You will explore the convergence of performance genres, the remediation of art works, theoretical concepts such as posthumanism and cybernetics, and how live performance engages with contemporary cultural change.
