Neuroscience is one of the major remaining frontiers in Biology.  Brain disease are major challenges facing society that may be answered by a greater understanding of how the activity of nerve cells and circuits in the brain controls our body and behaviour in health and disease. Furthermore, understanding of this amazing and complex organ can shed light not only on understanding our how our body organs are controlled, and how our responses to different external stimuli, but can also shed light on how prior experiences impact on these organ and body responses. Indeed, the complex processes that the brain uses to integrate different stimuli with prior experiences can also lead to new technologies and approaches to benefit society.   Neuroscience is a cross-disciplinary topic and the program introduces you to this study of the biology of the brain and how neural activity results in specific behaviours through different disciplines of Physiology, Psychology, Anatomy and Pharmacology. The flexibility of different subject options within the Program reflects this cross-disciplinary input into studying Brain and behaviour.
