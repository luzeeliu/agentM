This is an online course covering electromagnetism. Lecture material and tutorial problems will be presented online. This is the third course in the graduate certificate for physics teachers. This course will teach students about electromagnetism. Electromagnetism is the branch of physics concerned with studying interactions between electrically charged particles. In this course students will learn about electrical circuits containing resistors, capacitors and inductors. They will use Gauss's law to find electric fields and electric potentials around symmetric charge distributions. They will learn how to define and calculate capacitance. The course will also look at magnetic fields and magnetic inductance. Electromagnetic waves and optics will be considered. This course includes laboratory exercises that are completed at home and submitted online.
Assumed Knowledge:
Students need to be able to differentiate and integrate polynomials to complete this course. A good understanding of HSC level extension 1 mathematics is recommended.
