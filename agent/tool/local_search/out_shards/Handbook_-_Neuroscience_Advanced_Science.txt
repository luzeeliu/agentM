Neuroscience introduces students to the biological and behavioural aspects of the nervous system, and is based around the neuroscience courses offered by the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, and School of Psychology. This neuroscience major (NEURA1) is for Advanced Science students.
Important:
when planning to take this major, students should choose their courses carefully as some electives are prerequisites for courses in Stage 2 and 3. In particular, students should check the prerequisites for PHAR2011, PSYC2001, ANAT3411, and PHAR3202.
Please note:
Students who choose to do PSYC1111 are strongly recommended to also complete PSYC2001.
Neuroscience major (NEURA1) students can be exempted from the PSYC3051 prerequisite of PSYC2001 Research Methods 2, as long as they have completed NEUR2201 Neuroscience Fundamentals. Note, however, that this condition does not apply to any students who are undertaking a Psychology major (PSYCA1) in addition to a Neuroscience major, or any students enrolled in program 3435 (Bachelor of Psychological Science).
