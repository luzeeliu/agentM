Design and creative development are the engine of growth for economies and industry product portfolios. Chemical products touch consumers the world over, delivering innovations in pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, cosmetics, and foods.
In this course, you will continue to explore innovation in the chemical and food product sector, working on a novel consumer product that you planned in CEIC9007. You will develop a commercially viable chemical product, creating the full product formulation, prototypes, and accompanying documentation for your ideas. Designing and delivering new products to market is a complex process. Open-ended problems must be solved, requiring creativity, reflection, and quantitative analysis of results. These problems can have multiple correct approaches and that will require you to demonstrate your expertise through the practice of innovation, creativity and authoritative judgement. Industry partners will work with you to explore, create, and assess your product as it develops.
Whether you’re interested in developing new innovations for existing companies or for your own entrepreneurial efforts, you will gain confidence and independence that will enable you to make real contributions to the global economy.
This is the second course of the two course Product Research and Design Project sequence.
