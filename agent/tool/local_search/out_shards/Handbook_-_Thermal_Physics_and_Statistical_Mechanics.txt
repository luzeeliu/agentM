Thermal physics and statistical mechanics are concerned with the study of macroscopic and mesoscopic systems. Both aim to understand the properties and processes that occur in such systems with large numbers of particles. Statistical mechanics links mesoscopic and macroscopic properties of systems of matter and radiation with the fundamental microscopic physics (classical and quantum mechanics). It puts the concepts of thermodynamics on a firm mechanical foundation. Its importance in the development of modern society, from engines to refrigeration to the smallest transistor, cannot be overestimated. Topics to be covered include: classical thermodynamics; kinetic theory of gases; laws of thermodynamics; heat engines, Carnot cycle, Carnot’s theorem; classical entropy; thermodynamic potentials, Legendre transforms, Maxwell’s relations; thermodynamic probability, Boltzmann entropy; Boltzmann distribution, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions; partition functions, micro-canonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles; heat capacity, phonons, paramagnetism; blackbody radiation; Bose-Einstein condensation; Fermi energy, free electrons and the Fermi gas. This course consists of lectures, tutorials, and laboratory work. While not a prerequisite, students who have studied classical mechanics may find some interesting parallels.
