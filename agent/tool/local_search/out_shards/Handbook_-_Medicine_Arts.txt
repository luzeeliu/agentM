3856 - Independent Learning Project (ILP)
keyboard_arrow_down
Students are required to design their BMed Independent Learning Project (ILP) as a joint project with the Bachelor of Arts. 12 UOC of the 30 UOC that makes up the ILP will be double counted towards the Bachelor of Arts Prescribed Electives. If students do not want to pursue this option but want to complete other Bachelor of Arts Prescribed Electives they can do so. This will mean that they will need to do additional units of credit to meet the requirements of the program.
