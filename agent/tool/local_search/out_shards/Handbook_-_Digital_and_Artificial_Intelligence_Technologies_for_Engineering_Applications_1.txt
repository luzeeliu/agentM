This course provides essential knowledge and skills for engineers in the fields of sensing, digitalisation and data analytics, especially artificial intelligence (AI), for typical engineering applications. Topics include the following: sensors and modern acquisition systems; engineering signals and their time/frequency domain representation; support vector machines and neural networks for industrial applications; explainable artificial intelligence. This is done with a hands-on approach where students actually develop a digital sensing and data-analytic solution (student project) to an application challenge. The teaching team will strive to offer application challenges that relate to multiple engineering areas such as mechanical, aerospace, mechatronics and manufacturing engineering.
