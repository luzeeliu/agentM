Furniture and Lighting Design will engage you in the field of furniture and lighting design for social and environmental impact and innovation. Studio briefs will be framed around the use of designed objects as vessels for sharing critical perspectives, to inspire debate and activate personal and societal shifts in perspective and behaviour. As a ‘change agent’ your research will be driven by real life issues affecting individuals and/or communities, and your design outcomes will educate and activate social and ecological advancement. Design outcomes for this studio will be framed by your response to the brief.
You will work on one project throughout the course and have two sequential assessment tasks covering research, concept and design development, through to final design synthesis and presentation.
