Planning Practice: Consultation and Communication explores the importance of engaging communities to tap into their grounded experience and tacit knowledge of local social, natural and built environments. You will draw on real-world experiences of participatory processes to design stakeholder engagement strategies and apply appropriate engagement, consultation, monitoring and evaluation techniques. The communication component of the course builds on this, to help you enhance your skills in presenting and explaining complex planning issues to diverse audiences. You will also learn to effectively engage in adversarial contexts through mediation and negotiation.
Central to the practice year experience, this course guides you through your first role in the planning sector, provokes you to draw upon your own experiences to think more critically about the planning sector’s complex and competing objectives, and informs your development as a planning professional. You will bring real world examples of the opportunities and challenges of your professional placement into the classroom, and learn from the diversity of other students’ experiences to integrate insights across theory and practice.
