The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Commerce (3734) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Commerce (3764) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.
The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.
The Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) is a highly valued business qualification offering students a career-focused education for long term success. Students are empowered to become adaptive thinkers and drive purposeful change to thrive in a fast-changing world.
A unique feature of the BCom is the Integrated First Year, where students learn about business management and the broader environment in which an organisation operates, with a strong focus on developing professional skills and capabilities.
In this flexible, diverse and comprehensive business degree, students have exclusive access to Career Accelerator – an impressive suite of career-boosting opportunities. Completion of at least one for-credit Career Accelerator course is a signature feature of the BCom.
Students complete up to two majors, selecting from a comprehensive and industry advised suite, including Accounting, Business Analytics, Economics, Finance, FinTech, HR, Information Systems, International Business, Marketing and Taxation, many fulfilling professional accreditation requirements.
The myBCom Series, designed in collaboration with industry and alumni, guides students to develop a personalised roadmap to get the full benefit of the curricular and co-curricular opportunities offered in the BCom. Students graduate with their personal digital myBCom Graduate Portfolio, showcasing their academic, technical and practical career-ready skills and capabilities for a fulfilling career.
