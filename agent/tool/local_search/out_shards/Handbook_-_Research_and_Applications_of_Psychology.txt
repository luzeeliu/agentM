The primary purpose of this course is to provide a “capstone experience” (capping off and bringing together the various learning experiences from your degree) for students undertaking a major in psychology, regardless of their degree program. Psychology graduate attributes/capabilities should lead to the development of psychological literacy, which is useful for any career destination that involves interacting with other human beings. One of the key overarching goals of this course is for students to understand where and how theoretical concepts from psychology can be applied to issues in society. The course comprises online lectures, Q&A sessions, interactive tutorials and written reflections. Assessment is via presentations, written reports and a final exam.
