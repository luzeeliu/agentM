Tropical coral reefs are one of the world’s most diverse and important ecosystems. However coral reefs are also very sensitive ecosystems. Over the last few years, we have seen mass bleaching events and unprecedented levels of coral mortality around the world. Like many other ecosystems, coral reefs are under threat from a warming and acidifying ocean. To mitigate against future damage, we need to understand these threatened ecosystems, how they are affected by the physical and chemical environment, and how threats can be reduced to converse the coral reef systems.
This course will provide you with that broad understanding of the systems, threats and conversation efforts. You will learn about the components that make up a coral reef system: the coral animal/plant symbiosis, fish, algae, invertebrates and larger mammals, and the interactions between them. You will also learn about the physical environment: temperature, ocean currents, ocean chemistry that strongly affect the coral system, as well as how all these systems are being affected by climate change. Finally, you will investigate major threats faced by coral reefs and explore how we can manage and conserve these ecosystems.
The course will be delivered intensively in a combination of online and fieldtrip modes, with required attendance during the T2C teaching period (T2 examination period). Access to online modules will be available for students to gain an understanding of the coral ecosystems and prepare for the field trip at Heron Island Research Station in the Great Barrier Reef. On the island, you will be introduced to the incredible flora and fauna and conduct a reef-based field experiment.
The course includes a compulsory field trip to Heron Island Island that will incur personal costs to students.
