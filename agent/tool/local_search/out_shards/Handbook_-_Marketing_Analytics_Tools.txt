MARK5822 helps you to develop  capabilities of using advanced analytical tools to address marketing problems – key skills that numerous companies have stated they look for in marketers, particularly in challenging business environments.
You are exposed to a range of statistical tools and techniques, from classical statistical tools to emerging big data techniques. The emphasis is not on formulae of statistical tools, but on how to apply and interpret a range of statistical techniques to help answer marketing-related questions.
The course is organised around daily marketing problems. You are strongly encouraged to start thinking as marketers by asking questions of your data, setting your own direction for the analysis in the project and thinking about how a company could utilise the results in practice.
