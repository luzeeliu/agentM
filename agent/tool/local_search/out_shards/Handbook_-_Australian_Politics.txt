This course introduces you to the institutions, practices and principles of representative democracy and justice, within a comparative context. You will learn about the Australian constitutional framework, the separation of powers and the judicial system, the "unwritten constitution" of governing conventions, and human rights. You will come to appreciate Australian electoral systems and behaviour, as well as the institutions of Prime Minister, Cabinet and political leadership. The course considers the role of political parties, the media, and questions of citizenship in regard to sex and gender, race, and class. These elements of Australian representative democracy, as well as the controversial issues that they cover, are compared to their counterparts in other countries. This course is predicated on the assumption that democracy is full of paradoxes and contradictions that need to be understood in order to change the world.
