Can we continue to use fossil fuels for electricity? Think about climate change, global warming, and sustainable economy! Photovoltaic (PV) devices convert sunlight directly to electricity with low levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced. How affordable is photovoltaic electricity? Learn about how different components of the PV systems work, and how to calculate power generation by a PV system considering effect of factors such as temperature, and efficiency of the components. Using the parameters derived from laboratory exercises and simulations, you will develop a software model of a PV module and use this model to predict electricity generation at given solar irradiation and temperature. As a part of the capstone project, you will develop a PV system design program and use it to design a stand-alone PV system for a real world problem.
