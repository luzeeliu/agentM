Description
Provides an introduction to modern molecular biology and covers the molecular mechanisms of gene expression and fundamental aspects of recombinant DNA technology. The major topics covered include: the structure, function and properties of DNA and RNA; the replication and transcription of DNA; protein synthesis; regulation of gene expression; molecular biological techniques (DNA cloning, hybridization analysis, DNA sequencing, site-directed mutagenesis; the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microarrays); Bioinformatics; Applications of Molecular Biology; Biotechnology; and recent advances in molecular biology. Practical work to complement the lectures.
