How can you timetable classes to fit everyone’s schedule? Could tactical voting occur in Australia? Can a single computer program play and solve both sudoku and minesweeper?
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is at the core of Artificial Intelligence and the corresponding course, COMP4418, will equip you to answer the questions above and many other ones, so-called combinatorial problems. To do so, I will teach you “modeling”, that is the representation of a problem and its solutions in a way the computer can understand. You will learn a declarative programming language, a paradigm in which one only specifies what constitutes a solution to a problem and then leaves it to the computer to actually find the solution. With this new tool under your belt, you can effectively tackle most combinatorial problems coming your way, from planning and scheduling to digital circuit synthesis or some limited program verification.
