Description
Food processing is introduced in a series of integrated labs and lectures covering the basics of food engineering:  heat transfer and fluid flow.  This includes heat and mass balances, heat and mass transfer, Fourier's equation, modes of heat transfer, heat exchangers, transient heat transfer and Heisler charts for cans, food properties, physical chemistry of phases in crystalline, steam and enthalpy, thermal death, sterility, Fo, Z and D values, retorting, lethality, texture of solids and liquids, product flow and pumping, non-Newtonian behaviour, esp. viscoelasticity, and intermediate moisture foods.  Some example food operations are presented, including mixing powders and slurries, baking, frying, roasting, cooling, thawing, and freezing.
