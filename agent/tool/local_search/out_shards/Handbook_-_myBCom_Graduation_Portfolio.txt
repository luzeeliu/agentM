The COMM3999 myBCom Graduation Portfolio is the final part of a degree-spanning professional development exercise (myBCom) to ensure students are well-positioned to demonstrate employability standards in contextualised skills and capabilities, complemented by work-integrated learning and engagement in specialised learning communities.
In combination with the COMM1999 myBCom First Year Portfolio, it requires students to consciously reflect on the senior years of their BCom as a platform/vehicle to develop/build professional skills for graduate success. Many UNSW Business School students bring a strong ‘results focus’ with them. This mindset is harnessed and scaffolded through the integrative portfolio developed across the program and showcased upon graduation.
The myBCom Graduation Portfolio culminates in students curating their portfolio and producing learning statements in a personally selected or university ePortfolio platform that reflects their identity as a  UNSW Business School BCom graduate.  BCom students will communicate their professional digital identity narratives through the purposeful selection of digital artefacts focused on showcasing the BCom Program Learning Outcomes (PLO). Evidence of these outcomes include applied knowledge, problem solving, communication, teamwork, responsible business practice, global and cultural competence and leadership and align to the UNSW Graduate Attributes.  Ongoing guidance and support are also essential to achieving the development intent of the portfolio assessments and scaffolded throughout.
Students are required to complete activities on the myBCom platform:

Students need to obtain at minimum 40 points per PLO (course and experience) on the myBCom platform by the end of term as a component to passing the course.
