What skills will you need for your career in ten years? How can businesses become sustainable for the future?
COMM5044 Future of Work Project is a project-based practicum aimed at developing and applying your business and consulting knowledge while learning to tackle challenges facing a future workforce. In small cross-disciplinary teams (maximum 5 students) you will work with an industry host to investigate a real-life business challenge relating to their future sustainability, while applying your teamwork, creativity and cross-cultural communication skills. You will then present your findings and recommendations to a group of industry professionals.
Throughout the course you will also reflect on key future work issues such as AI and sustainability, and how they relate to yourself and your project. You will be supported by an industry mentor and your lecturer.
Each practicum experience will be different depending on the organisations we partner with.
For enquiries please contact the Career Accelerator team.
