This course provides participants the opportunity to undertake advocacy or policy-oriented research in a partner organisation or to self-organise an internship with a host organisation of interest to the student (subject to approval). The course provides formal and informal online engagement at UNSW Law & Justice with supervised practical experience in the host organisation. Students will be critically analysing the operation of the law, policy, and the legal system as part of the course.
Students will undertake supervised work within the host organisation for 70 hours, the equivalent of one day each week over 10 weeks. Days and hours are arranged directly between the student and host organisation and may be worked flexibly as agreed. Course work is by online asynchronous activities and online supervision with a Law & Justice Faculty academic supervisor who will be responsible for monitoring academic progression throughout the term
The range of projects in which the intern will be involved is determined according to the project priorities of the host organisation. However, in general it is expected that an intern’s duties will consist of a combination of advocacy, research, project administrative work, interviewing clients, preparing legal materials editing, writing, event coordination, preparing background materials, briefing papers, liaising with other organisations, and doing relevant work of a substantive nature.
Interns are required to read the course materials, and actively participate in the online forums on Moodle. These are designed to promote discussion and reflection on a range of issues that may arise during the internship – for example, legal, professional, ethical, and personal issues. They may also address the application of skills such as legal research, legal writing, advocacy, and interviewing.
Attendance by interns at the host organisation for the required hours, and completion of online activities/ assessments is mandatory.
