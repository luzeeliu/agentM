This advanced course within the Graphics disciplinary studio will extend the skills you have developed in the introductory and intermediate courses into three-dimensional places and spaces, with an emphasis on research and critical thinking. You will develop interpretive narratives through graphic interventions, alongside strategies for the installation of your responses. Expressed through a design proposition and subsequent development of a graphic design project, we will continue our established disciplinary focus on typographic skills alongside a broad range of image making techniques.
