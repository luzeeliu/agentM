In this course, students will conduct a short research project supervised by a member of academic staff. The research project may encompass laboratory experiments, field studies, theoretical studies, or data syntheses. The project will include all aspects of research, including project planning, data collection, statistical analyses, and oral and written reporting. Projects may also involve ‘placements’ outside UNSW. In these cases, students will require an academic member of staff to supervise the research project.
Students in this course will acquire and build essential skills such as a critical assessment of the literature, managing a research project, data collection and interpretation, and scientific communication.
The range of research projects that can be conducted in this course means the assessment structure detailed here is more flexible than in more traditional courses. The academic supervisor will clarify details of the assessments at the beginning of the course. Students are not expected to fund their own research.
Note: This course is restricted to students undertaking a Major in the School of BEES. Enrolment in this course is by invitation and subject to availability of places: interested students should contact a suitable supervisor and the Director of Teaching
