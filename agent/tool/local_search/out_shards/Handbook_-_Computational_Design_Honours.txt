The purpose of Honours within the Discipline of Computational Design is to enable students who have performed well at undergraduate level to deepen their knowledge of design methods, literature and history by undertaking a significant research project. Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Professional Masters, Masters by research or a PhD. As part of the Honours program students will be expected to complete a significant independent research project and coursework study. Students will generally also be expected to undertake research literacy training, Integrity in research training, attend OH & S and safety training in the Faculty's Squarehouse studios and present at Faculty research seminars.
