​In this course, students reflect on their own experiences accumulated through the coursework and co-curricular activities in the Bachelor of Commerce Integrated First Year. The myBCom First Year Portfolio has been designed for students to develop and demonstrate the acquisition of the first year standard of the BCom Program Learning Outcomes through a range of evidence. Through review and reflection on learning artefacts and experiences collected throughout the Integrated First Year, students will identify evidence that demonstrates the minimum standards to curate an experiential and integrative portfolio. The curated portfolio demonstrates learning across the BCom through the BCom Program Learning Outcomes (PLO). Evidence of these outcomes include applied knowledge, problem solving, communication, teamwork, responsible business practice, global and cultural competence and leadership and align to the UNSW Graduate Attributes. The myBCom First Year Portfolio learning design promotes the knowledge, understanding, and skills that promote success across the BCom via a skills dashboard and curated learning portfolio that serves as supplementary documentation for potential employers or further academic study.
Students need to obtain at minimum 25 points per PLO (course and experience) on the myBCom platform by the end of term as a component to passing the course.
