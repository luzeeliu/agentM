Description
This course is a cross-Faculty offering from Science and Medicine, that will address six big questions in modern neuroscience. A new question will be explored each fortnight in lectures, a laboratory class and tutorial. The focus of the course is on the range of disciplines that contribute to the field of neuroscience, and each fortnight’s topic will be taught by academics from two or more disciplines (Anatomy, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychology) using an integrated approach.  Students will develop an insight into how problems in neuroscience are investigated, and an appreciation of some current issues.  The course is a compulsory part of the Neuroscience study plan in Advanced Science (NEURA13972) and in Science (NEURS13970) but is open to other students. The pre-requisites are 12 units of BABS or BIOS courses or 12 units of PSYC courses, but students are advised that the following courses will provide a useful background: ANAT2511 BIOC2101 PHSL2101 PSYC2081.
Please note: students may not enrol in NEUR3221 Neurophysiology in the same semester as NEUR2201, or prior to NEUR2201.
