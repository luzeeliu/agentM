Interior Architecture Technics 2 focuses on the basic constructional assembly systems and components of interior architectural building elements. You will learn about the core considerations of structure, substrate, and skin. You will explore these basic construction assembly systems from a macro to micro scale, starting from larger elements of the interior to smaller joinery items. You will develop the technical documentation techniques required as an industry professional through lectures and studio-based workshops. You will explore the role of the builder versus the role of the interior architect and the coordination between the two. Emphasis is placed on your ability to resolve and employ basic building elements as informed by design intent, aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability thematic. This course is educationally sequenced alongside all other Year 2 Interior Architecture (Hons) and Interior Technics courses.
