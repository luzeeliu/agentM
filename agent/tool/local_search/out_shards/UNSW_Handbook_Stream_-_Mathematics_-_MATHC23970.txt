Stream Outline
The UNSW School of Mathematics and Statistics offers a complete range of courses in Mathematics and Statistics at all levels. The School is also a leading centre for mathematical research at both the national and the international level; our expertise ranges across wide areas of Mathematics, including Financial Mathematics, Biomedical Mathematics, and Environmental Mathematics.
Stream Structure
A minor in Mathematics is comprised of 36 UOC of courses as follows:
Stage 1
MATH1131 Mathematics 1A
(6 UOC)
or
MATH1141 Higher Mathematics 1A
(6 UOC)
MATH1231 Mathematics 1B
(6 UOC)
or
MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B
(6 UOC)
Stage 2 / Stage 3
24 units of credit of level 2 or higher non-statistics mathematics courses, which must include at least 6 UOC at level 3 or higher.
Notes:
Non stats courses are those MATH courses whose second digit is neither 8 nor 9.
The majority of level 3 Mathematics courses require 6-12 UOC of level 2 Mathematics courses as prerequisites. Students should be aware of these prerequisite requirements as listed in the Handbook and plan their enrolment accordingly.
