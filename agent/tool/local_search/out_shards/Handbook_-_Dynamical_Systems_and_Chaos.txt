Many nonlinear systems do not have explicit solutions. The dynamical systems approach shifts the focus from finding explicit solutions to discovering geometric properties of solutions. It also recognises that even a small amount of nonlinearity in a physical system can be responsible for very complicated chaotic behaviour.

Many nonlinear systems do not have explicit solutions. The dynamical systems approach shifts the focus from finding explicit solutions to discovering geometric properties of solutions. It also recognises that even a small amount of nonlinearity in a physical system can be responsible for very complicated chaotic behaviour. During lectures and tutorials, students will learn the fundamentals of dynamical systems in discrete-time maps and continuous-time ODEs, allowing them to analyse the local and global behaviour of dynamical systems. Students will also learn how to analyse time series data using nonlinear tools and build appropriate predictive model.
