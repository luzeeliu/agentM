The functionality and capability of computer systems are defined by their real-world hardware. Likewise, the cyber security of computer systems depends upon the security of their underlying hardware. This course is designed to explore both hardware security and trust in hardware, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underpinning principles and practices which apply to both the security and trust of computer systems, from printed circuit boards to individual integrated circuits. Students will explore theoretical aspects of what makes hardware secure, performing threat modelling and understanding the state of the art in hardware security, as well as get hands-on experience with practical attacks and defences for both virtual and real-world hardware. The course will equip students with the skills necessary to analyse, design, and implement hardware security measures.
