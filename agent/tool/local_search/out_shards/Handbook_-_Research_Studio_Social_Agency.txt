The Graduation Studio in the Master of Architecture Program runs over two terms; the first term is the Research Studio where you will engage in a design-based research inquiry to develop a conceptual framework for your graduation project, along with your initial architectural proposals. The second term is the Major Design Studio where you develop your proposal into a highly resolved architecture project.
In the Research Studio, you will select a thematic option allied with the UNSW Built Environment Architecture Program streams, namely: Architecture and High-Performance Technology; Architecture and Housing, Architecture and Social Agency, and Architecture and Urban Conditions. The Research Studio structure encourages and supports theoretical and site research, as well as exploration, speculation and analysis. Weekly studio-based activities guide your development of a conceptual architectural proposal that describes the parameters and architectural ambitions of your individual project.
