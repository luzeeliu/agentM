This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The major specialisation in Advanced French Studies enables you to study French beginning at the Advanced or Professional entry level. You will not only develop your knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.
There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people's expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions.
This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.
