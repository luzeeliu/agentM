This intermediate course within the 3D Visualisation disciplinary studio will help you explore 3D computer visualisations through the creation of a digital 3D environment. Building on the skills already acquired in the introductory course to create a 3D virtual asset in isolation, you will now create multiple assets before laying them out in a complete, fully realised virtual scene. To successfully complete this process, you will need to consider how assets engage and relate to each other and the space they inhabit. The creation of the virtual scene will be conceptually driven and supported by theoretical research. Engaging studio workshops will explore the full Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) workflow with a particular emphasis on CGI lighting, rendering techniques and clear art direction. This course will provide you with an increased ability to apply the knowledge and skills that are used in the field of computer modelling and Computer-Generated visualisation to the creation of your own 3D virtual worlds.
