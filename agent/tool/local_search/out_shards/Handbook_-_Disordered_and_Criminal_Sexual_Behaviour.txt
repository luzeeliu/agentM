Forensic sexology and, in particular, sexually disordered behaviour, are topical, interesting and exciting areas of study. This course covers a body of research over the past 150 years, and the explosion of a broad range of studies on sexually disordered and sexual offending from the 1980s onwards.
Topics studied during this course detail the definitions, epidemiology, aetiology, presentations, diagnosis, assessment issues, treatment and management, recidivism, and risk assessment of the paraphilic disorders. This includes the clinical assessment and comprehensive understanding of the paraphilic disorders including exhibitionism, sexual sadism, paedophilia, zoophilia, necrophilia, voyeurism, frotteurism; those paraphilic disorders or criminal sexual behaviours involving activities which would bring these individuals to the attention of authorities such as transvestism or cybersex; incest; rape; biological and psychosocial sex offender treatments; risk assessment and risk management of these offending behaviours or paraphilic disorders.
