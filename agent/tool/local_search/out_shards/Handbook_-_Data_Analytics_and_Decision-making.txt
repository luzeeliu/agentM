Evidence-based decision-making supported by a data-driven culture is essential to the management of organisations. It is therefore essential that professionals are able to define problems clearly and systematically, know what techniques can be applied in order to solve these problems, and communicate the results concisely and effectively.
The first step in the process of data analysis and decision-making is to frame business problems in a quantitative matter and learn how data collection and experimentation can help provide the right insights.
As the second step, you will learn how to solve problems through predictive models. This requires a basic understanding of statistics and therefore you study the basics of regression provided by the Harvard Quantitative Methods online course during the first half of the course. This will help improve your data literacy in order to communicate more effectively with data scientists as well as contribute to the democratisation of data within your business.
Finally, you will learn the basics of using Tableau and Python, two of the visualisation and data analytics tools in the field. Through data storytelling, you will learn to communicate data more effectively and improve your ability to simplify problems and facilitate decision-making.
With these three steps, this course will enable you to make quicker, better and more intelligent decisions and allow you to create value in the broadest sense within your business.
