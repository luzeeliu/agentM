Film festivals can have a powerful effect on cinema, but they can also be important events for communities and local economies. In this course you will develop an understanding of the internal workings of a film festival by examining the creative, historical, economic and logistical demands of staging a range of film festivals. You will examine the major movements, production trends and scholarly debates in the study of film festivals and some of the films that appear at specific film festivals. You will work collaboratively to produce a short film during the course that will either document a specific film festival and their community or will be a short film submitted to a festival. You will learn how producing a film in a specific context may address ethical and philosophical questions concerning the relationship between filmmakers, the community, and audiences. In addition to developing your production skills, you will gain valuable experience in writing and pitching and developing the idea for a new, unique curated film festival.
