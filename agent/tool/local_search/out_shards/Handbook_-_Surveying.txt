The Surveying specialisation aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and Geospatial Engineering. To this end the specialisation covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Geospatial Engineering topics. The specialisation is provided through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year research thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner.
The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Geospatial Council of Australia and Engineers Australia, for admission as members.
