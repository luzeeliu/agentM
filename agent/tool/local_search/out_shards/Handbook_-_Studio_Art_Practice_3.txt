Studio Art Practice 3 is the third in a sequence of six core courses that enables you to develop your independent artistic practice. This course builds on Studio Art Practice 1-2, and helps you to develop an awareness of how artists respond to a diverse range of influences and contexts through their practices. Through a series of structured studio classes, you are encouraged to consider how the studio provides a site not only for the transformation of materials, but also for the exploration of artistic, social, and cultural contexts. With an emphasis on identifying and responding to spheres of influence, this course allows you to explore new ways of working with materials, processes, and ideas. To support a focus on making, weekly topics provide diverse examples of how other artists have explored social and cultural contexts through material experiments and processes. By encouraging class discussions and collaborative work, this course also allows you to continue to develop your interpersonal and peer-to-peer skills as you advance your independent practice.
