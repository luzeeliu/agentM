Landscape Architecture is a design discipline which is concerned with the environment as a whole. Students at UNSW learn the theory and practice of Landscape Architecture through the exploration of design principles, graphic techniques, ecological processes and studies of human modification of the environment. The emphasis of the program is on creative design inspired by the Australian situation, and prepares our students to work anywhere in the world.
The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (Hons) degree provides research-led academic education in the practice, theory and application of landscape architecture. The four-year, fulltime degree includes an embedded honours and leads to professional qualifications in landscape architecture. Upon completion, you will be ready to design sustainable, adaptive and resilient landscapes that ensure ecological and social health of environments that we all live, work and play in.
Landscape Architecture is an in-demand profession that advocates for improved environments for humans and all living species. We consider landscape architecture as the critical design profession in the spatial design of public spaces within cities and the regions. Throughout your four-years you will synthesise your knowledge and skills through real-world project-based learning in a sequence of ten Design Studios. In your final year, you will undertake a significant, research-led independent design study.
The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (Hons) aims to produce high quality, employable graduates who are independent critical thinkers, global thought leaders, and advocates for improved environments and their communities. Your knowledge and skills in Landscape Architecture Design, Design Communications, Landscape Architecture History and Theory, Natural and Cultural Systems and Professional Practice provides you with confidence in your preparation as professional Landscape Architect with a pathway towards professional Registration.
At UNSW landscape architecture is taught as a powerful way of thinking and influencing change for the environments of human and more than human species. Graduates of the UNSW landscape architecture program are creative problem solvers and strong advocates, able to draw on a depth and range of knowledge , skills and interdisciplinary experiences. UNSW equips you with the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to address ecological challenges, social equity and human health through design at a range of scales.
