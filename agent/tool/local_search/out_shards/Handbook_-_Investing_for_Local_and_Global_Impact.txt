Investing with the specific aim of achieving positive social and/or environmental impact has become increasingly recognised as holding enormous potential for unlocking private capital, enabling new solutions to pressing social and environmental challenges, and helping to shape a new landscape that is blurring the traditional lines between investment and philanthropy. Investments can be made by business and corporations, governments and individual investors (small and large) while social purpose organisations are developing investment strategies to attract investors to finance the development of social innovation and to trial environmentally friendly production processes and delivery. Impact investment has been particularly popular within developing and emerging markets across the globe.  The aim of this course is to examine the history, concepts and current practices in investing for local and global impact while providing the opportunity to develop practical skills in including the development and application of social impact investment strategies from an investor, investee and policy development perspective.
COMM5204 Investing for Local and Global Impact is a general elective in the Finance specialisation and an elective in the Global Sustainability and Social Enterprise specialisation in the Master of Commerce and Master of Commerce (Extension) programs.
