Description
Bacteria and Disease aims to provide students with a high level of understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms used by a diverse array of bacterial pathogens to cause human disease. In addition, the epidemiology and strategies used to  control and prevent these infectious diseases will be discussed.   The lecture program will include key pathogens infecting different body systems.  In conjunction with the lecture program, the laboratory program will provide students with  practical experience in contemporary medical microbiology techniques used  for the diagnosis of bacterial infections. In addition, students  will develop their research skills by conducting a research project on the isolation and characterisation of a common bacterial pathogen using conventional and molecular techniques.
