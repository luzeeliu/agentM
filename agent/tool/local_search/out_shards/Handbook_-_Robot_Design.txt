Mobile robotic systems play an increasingly important role in modern societies. MTRN3100 aims at developing skills on how to design and implement the capabilities of a mobile robotic platform. The course begins with an introduction to robot design, locomotion, and sensing methods. Then, primary localisation and kinematics for mobile robots are studied in detail. The course further delves into different techniques for path planning and computer vision in mobile robotics. Finally, more advanced topics such as Kalman-Filter-based localisation and simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) are introduced. The course includes both theories covered in the lectures and assessed in the quizzes and practices trained in the labs and assignments. Students will integrate the introduced techniques into a problem-solving project.
