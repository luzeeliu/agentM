This course provides an introduction to the functional relationships between living organisms and the environments in which they live. There is an emphasis on interactions within and between populations, ecological energetics, ecophysiology, and the theory of evolution by natural selection. In this, we cover a wide range of life forms from plants, animals, and microbes. This course also serves as an introduction to the process of scientific enquiry. This course is targeted toward individuals interested in learning more about ecology or evolution. Lectures are provided online and students will attend in-person practicals with high levels of hands-on experience with lab work and discussion.
