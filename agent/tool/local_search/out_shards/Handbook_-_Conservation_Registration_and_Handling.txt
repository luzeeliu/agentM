The collection, preservation and conservation of objects and artworks is a central role of the cultural sector. The way we understand objects and their relations to collections are changing. Likewise, new art practices and non-object based projects provide challenges to organisations whose mission is to display and preserve contemporary culture.
Professionals working with diverse collections need to be able to identify and comply with various and sometimes competing frameworks of significance and value when working with material culture. As well as examining the recording of collections and exhibitions, you will consider issues relevant to material preservation and conservation addressing debates of cultural sensitivity and significance in order to understand how collection policies determine what gets preserved in contemporary institutions. An understanding of these issues and adoption of these skills will ensure best practice when handling objects in both exhibition and collection management settings. This course will help you develop knowledge of the professional procedures required of galleries, museums and custodians of cultural heritage. The content will engage with leading arts organisations so that you will understand how these procedures operate within diverse gallery and institutional contexts.
