Creative advertising can be engaging, exhilarating, and even world changing. But what is creativity and how does it work? How do practitioners gain deep insights into clients and their problems? How do they make the creative leap that brings an idea to life? This course will help you to develop the ability valued most highly in organisations today—the ability to think and solve problems creatively. The creative teams within an advertising agency are in the business of generating original and engaging ideas that will solve a client’s communication problem. Combining conceptual thinking with practical approaches, you will focus on developing the creative dimensions for advertising campaigns related to contemporary problems ranging from low product awareness through to public social issues. Each week, you will engage imaginatively with client briefs and develop advertising concepts all the while exploring the history of creative theory and practice, as well as the storytelling, art direction, copywriting, and pitching aspects of creative advertising.
