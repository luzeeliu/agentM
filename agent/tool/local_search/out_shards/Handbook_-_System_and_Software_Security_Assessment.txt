This course looks at cyber attack and defence. Students learn how to assess and identify vulnerabilities and how vulnerabilities are exploited. Students learn the principles and theory of exploitation, the common security models, and how approaches to exploitation and defence have evolved over time.
Students from this course will engage in wargames, analyse real world case studies of vulnerabilities in complex software used on widespread systems, and gain an understanding of the technical process of finding and fixing low-level software vulnerabilities and also of the economics and causal factors involved with their real world use.
The course covers techniques and skills including vulnerability classes, source code auditing,fuzzing, security bugs, software security assurance, taint analysis, memory corruption, overflows and return oriented programming. The course coverage will be constantly updated over time to reflect emerging attack and defence methods.
There are numerous formative assessments and activities throughout the course to provide feedback and learning opportunities.
Students need a keen, devious and analytical mind.
To get the most from this course you will need to engage in independent study and act as a self-directed learner. Attending lectures alone will not be sufficient to pass the course. You will need to devote considerable practice to all the techniques we cover and read further on topics which interest you or which you do not fully understand. For a credit level result we expect you will spend 15 hours per week in total on this course.
Seek feedback from your friendly lecturers, tutors and class peers constantly over the term and closely monitor yourself to make sure you are not falling behind. Experience has shown that students who do not work hard at the course do not do well, and often express disappointment later on at the missed opportunity.
