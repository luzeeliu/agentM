PATH3210 will provide you with an overview of how different imaging techniques work and how to apply them to obtain multidimensional data about disease processes. You will gain insight into how images are formed and processed for analysis, and in turn how to critically evaluate the quality of an imaging experiment. Key topics that will be covered include sample preparation, effective use of imaging instruments, the use of artificial intelligence for segmentation and how to obtain quantitative data from imaging experiments.
Building on this knowledge we explore how to apply imaging technologies for fundamental biomedical research and within the clinical environment. Collectively this provides a solid basis for future careers in biomedical imaging in research, the clinic or in industry.
