This course will cover the intelligence and data analysis techniques and skills that will help businesses improve their detection and response to cybersecurity attacks. These techniques can be applied before, during, and after an attack to gain actionable information that will reveal a business’ capability gaps, pain points, and requirements. Students will be exposed to the mindset, tactics, and techniques of cyber adversaries, so that they can leverage established frameworks and best practices to put forward effective countermeasures.
The course will also cover the fundamentals of digital forensics, which help business managers acquire a better understanding of what is behind the devices and systems they use, and leverage this body of knowledge to improve their organisation’s incident response and threat prevention. Like police technology detectives in the 1990s, students will learn how to gather high-quality digital evidence, as well as analyse them to understand how information systems and networks can be compromised and, at the same time, how to protect them.
