Data modelling allows us to understand the relationship of various data within a system. Within an aviation context, data modelling can be used in areas such as safety data analytics, aviation econometrics and sustainability to model and forecast scenarios to optimise processes and understand how to improve systems. In this course, students will learn about the various tools and techniques used to perform data modelling in the aviation industry and how to apply these to various challenges in an aviation context. This course will focus on data modelling with machine learning-based models and neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) models in aviation. Theories underpinning machine learning models and AI models will be covered in this course to provide students with theoretical knowledge about data modelling. Data analytics and Python programming skills are included to provide students with problem-solving skills in data preparation, exploration and modelling. Students are provided with computer programming training in the Python language. Tutorial sessions are an essential and significant part of this course. Data modelling projects are an integral part of this course to provide students with hands-on experience in building data models and practising programming skills.
