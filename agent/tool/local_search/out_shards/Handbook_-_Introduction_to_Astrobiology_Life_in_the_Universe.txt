Astrobiology is the study of the search for life elsewhere in the universe, the origin of life on Earth, and the future of life on Earth. The course emerged from the UNSW Australian Centre for Astrobiology, which is deeply embedded in the search for life on Mars and the origin of life on Earth. The course is fully online, and there is no final exam.
The content ranges from our origin in the Big Bang at the beginning of the universe to the study of microbes that live in extreme environments on Earth, how life and our planet evolved together and the search for life elsewhere in our solar system and beyond. Astrobiology seeks to answer our most profound question: Are we alone in the universe?
This second-level course addresses astrobiology from the microbiological, geological and palaeobiological perspectives to the development of life on Earth and the search for life elsewhere in the universe. BEES2741 is strongly interdisciplinary.
