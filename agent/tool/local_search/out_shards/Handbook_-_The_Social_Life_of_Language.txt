In this course we explore the relationship between language and society and the ways in which language maintains, develops and changes dimensions of social and cultural relationships and identities. We examine these through a range of topics including language variation according to class, region, ethnicity, age, and gender; Speech Acts and Politeness; inter-cultural communication and cross-cultural pragmatics; language contact; language attitudes and beliefs; language and discrimination. These topics are relevant to many fields of study including education, international studies, the law, health, and the media. They are also increasingly relevant in our daily lives with globalisation highlighting the significance of intergroup and interpersonal relations. Key content of the course involves interactive scenarios, reflective activities, and discussion leading towards analytic conclusions. These activities provide opportunities to apply the knowledge acquired throughout the course to real world examples and personal experiences as language users.
