We have all taken part in some kind of “research” (such as surveys, focus groups or interviews) at some time or other. However, many people do not have an understanding of what comprises “true” market research. How should a market research project be set up? Are there ways to collect data other than through questionnaires? How should the data be analysed and presented? When and why should market research be conducted? These are questions that will be investigated in this course.
Marketing research involves the systematic identification, collection, analysis and dissemination of information undertaken to improve managerial decision making across all areas of marketing. In this course, we examine various marketing management concepts and models covered in other marketing courses and consider the research process in collecting information and building knowledge necessary for decision making. Examining the marketing research process for a broad array of marketing management decisions further complements the wider array of subjects taught in the Master of Commerce marketing specialisation, and the Master of Commerce in general.
This course provides an overview of the various forms of marketing research that are used by practising marketing managers to make informed decisions. The emphasis will be upon research for marketing managers and as such, this course will pay particular attention to the role of research in management decision making. The course looks at each stage of the research process – from problem definition, to research design and design implementation, to data analysis and reporting of results. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are considered.
