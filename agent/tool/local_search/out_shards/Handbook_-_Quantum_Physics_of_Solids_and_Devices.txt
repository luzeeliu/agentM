The coupling of Solid State Physics and Quantum Physics is the basis for virtually all technological aspects of modern life. Quantum mechanics plays an important role in the properties of solids, and will be central to new generations of electronic devices across the coming decades, e.g., quantum computers. Existing devices, such as laser diodes and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), also exploit quantum phenomena for their operation. The course will appeal to those seeking a better contextual understanding of quantum mechanics and to learn about its real world applications: past, present and future.
Through a series of lecture, tutorial and laboratory classes, this course covers three main areas. The first is ‘The Quantum Physics of Solids’, with topics including crystal structure, phonons as quantum oscillations, electrons as quantum particles in solids, band structure and unconventional materials. The second is ‘Interactions in Quantum Systems’, with topics including paramagnetism, diamagnetism and ferromagnetism, electron-electron interactions and their role in screening and plasmonic effects, and superconductivity. The third is ‘From Semiconductors to Quantum Devices’, with topics including charge carriers in semiconductors, p-n junctions and diodes, finite solids and heterojunctions, quantum confinement and low-dimensional devices, nanoelectronics.
