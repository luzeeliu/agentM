Description
This course examines how movement is controlled from brain to skeletal muscle. The major themes are the contribution of the brain and spinal cord to the control of movement, muscle function, motor learning, movement disorders, fatigue and ageing. A series of advanced practical classes will range from experiments with isolated mammalian muscle to human studies with electromyography. The lectures, practicals and tutorials will be complemented by a series of expert seminars which provide insight into current research in the field and reinforce the relationship between integrative neuromotor function, movement physiology and the cellular and molecular physiology underlying muscle and motor control.
