This course is concerned with laws that impose significant legal restrictions upon what the media, or other communicators to large-scale audiences, may publish under Australian law. The subject matter is as relevant to the publication of books, films and videos as to newspapers and broadcast programs, and the legal problems presented by the new technologies receive special emphasis. The course begins with some consideration of the meaning or meanings of freedom of expression and the extent to which it is protected in general terms under Australian constitutional law. Special attention is paid also to broad political and philosophical theories about the notions of free speech and censorship. The focus then turns to specific laws having a significant daily impact on the contents of publications. This includes the law relating to racial vilification, blasphemy, sedition, publication of obscene material and contempt of court.
