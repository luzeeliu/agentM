This course examines the characteristics, source and fate of metal contaminants in natural and urban environments, via a combination of lectures, laboratories and a field excursion. The course covers (1) primary and secondary dispersion of elements and weather processes; (2) principles of water, soil, drainage sediments, rocks and vegetation geochemistry as applied to environmental assessments; (3) aqueous geochemistry and contaminant modelling, with reference to Australian case studies; and (4) introduction to geochemical sampling, analytical techniques and the design of environmental surveys. The course involves a series of recorded lectures and prescribed readings that provide an overall framework to the main themes and supports the laboratories in which students will examine regolith materials and undertake modelling and interpretation of various real-world geochemical datasets.
Assumed Knowledge: students should have completed at least one of: GEOS1111, GEOS1211 or GEOS1701 and HSC-level Chemistry.
