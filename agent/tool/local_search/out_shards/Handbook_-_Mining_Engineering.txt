This stream extends over four years when taken full-time. Year 1 of the stream includes courses that cover the sciences to provide the foundation for many of the engineering courses offered in Year 2. Year 3 is largely devoted to fundamental courses in mining engineering while Year 4 provides advanced instruction in aspects essential for all mining engineers. Elective courses are offered in both Year 3 and Year 4 of the stream.
An important requirement in the fourth year is for students to undertake personal research or a study project in mining or minerals engineering for which they are required to submit a dissertation for examination. After graduation, mining engineers who choose to develop careers in operations management gain further practical experience to obtain a Mine Manager's Certificate of Competency, in either Coal or Metalliferous Mining. Formal arrangements are in place with the University of Newcastle for students who have completed a specified program to be admitted with advanced standing to Year 3 of the program at UNSW.
Stream Structure
The stream structure shown indicates one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the stream rules.
As the stream structure indicates, a number of course electives are offered each term in Year 3 and Year 4. This allows the student to specialize in systems of mining either surface or underground or both; in advanced studies of core technical fields; or, opt for a broader professional perspective.
