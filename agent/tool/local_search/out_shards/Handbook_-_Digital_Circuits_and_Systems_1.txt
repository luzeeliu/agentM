This course teaches students the fundamentals of digital design.
It introduces the components of digital systems, explains how these are described in the IEEE standard hardware description language VHDL and familiarizes the student with the implementation of digital circuits using FPGA prototyping boards.
This course founds studies in computer architecture, embedded systems and configurable logic design, and also forms the basis for a deeper understanding of the hardware underpinnings of operating systems, compilers, networks, graphics systems, etc.
In this course, we attempt to provide you with a rigorous and thorough grounding in the essential skills you will need to carry out digital design activities in the follow-on courses of Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems Design (Design Project A) and Configurable Systems Design (Design Project B).
