The Chemistry stream is designed for students who wish to specialise in the chemical sciences and undertake the maximum number of Chemistry courses. It is designed to provide education and training in all contemporary fields of chemistry, and should be selected by students who wish to devote the majority of their studies at Stage III to Chemistry.
The School of Chemistry recommends the following complementary discipline areas for a major in Chemistry: Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Earth Science, Materials Science, Mathematics or Physical Sciences. Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry. Chemistry with Physics or Materials Science allows entry into the rapidly developing field of advanced materials.
