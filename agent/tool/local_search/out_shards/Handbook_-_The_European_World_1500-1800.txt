The European world, 1500-1800 is an introductory course to early-modern history. It aims to provide a general knowledge of European politics, society, economy and culture between the Renaissance and the French Revolution. We will focus on the most significant events and developments that shaped European history, including the rise of humanism, religious reform, state formation and centralisation, overseas expansion, global capitalism, and the emergence of representative government. We will look at the consequences brought by these developments, most notably on European political and cultural practices; and study how they impacted traditional understandings of human nature to give rise to modern ideas of human rights.
