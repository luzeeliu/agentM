The School of Mathematics and Statistics (MathsStats) offers a number of Honours streams including in Pure Mathematics. The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia's finest mathematicians.
Students who enrol in the Pure Mathematics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of pure mathematics may also apply for entry to this stream.
Honours in Pure Mathematics can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1  but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.
Entry Requirements
So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the Pure Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.
To enter honours in pure mathematics, students must have
Completed a mathematics major in the Science or Advanced Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics of which at least 18uoc must be in level III pure mathematics,
or
Completed Stage 3 of the pure mathematics plans in the Advanced Mathematics degree
or
;
Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.
In addition
, students will normally be required to have:
An average above 70 in their level III mathematics courses
and
An average above 70 in level III pure mathematics courses.
The level III pure mathematics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3400 to MATH3799 inclusive.
With the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Pure Mathematics Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.

Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.
You are responsible for ensuring that you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and by following the advice of your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program requirements.
Additional Information
The thesis component of pure mathematics honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time) can complete the honours thesis  in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.
Students will also be required to participate in the regular honours meetings, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. These meetings are intended to allow students to practice their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities. Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.
The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff and will include an oral presentation component.
The 30uoc coursework component of pure mathematics honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses), normally including both MATH5605 and MATH5735.  The full suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.
The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:
Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over
Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84
Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74
Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64
Pathways
Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.

Graduates of a mathematics or statistics honours plan are also well qualified to find employment in many sectors. Past honours graduates have found employment in areas such as banking, computing, education, finance, government, medical research and meteorology. The Australian Mathematical Society (
http://www.austms.org.au/HomePage
) and Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (
http://www.amsi.org.au/
) maintain up-to-date information on career prospects in mathematics and statistics.
