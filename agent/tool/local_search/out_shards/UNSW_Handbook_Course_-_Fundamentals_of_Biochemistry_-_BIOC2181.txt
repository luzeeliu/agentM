Description
Introduces modern biochemistry, covers fundamental aspects of the structure-function relationships of proteins and an overall coverage of intermediary metabolism. Major topics covered include: the nature and functions of enzymes; the metabolic working of cells, tissues and organs; the interrelationships between pathways of carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism; the vital roles of enzymes and hormones in catalysis and metabolic regulation; the energy trapping mechanisms of animals and plants; interesting variations on the central metabolic pathways in various life forms. Practical work to complement the lectures and to introduce the principles of biochemical analysis. This course covers essentially the same material as in
BIOC2101
Principles of Biochemistry (Advanced), but in less detail and with more emphasis on the function of organisms and less emphasis on some of the underlying chemical mechanisms.
Note: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Biochemistry as an alternative to
BIOC2101
for students who do not intend to proceed to Level III Biochemistry. It does not fulfill the prerequisite requirements for Level III Biochemistry but the Head of School may give approval for students with a grade of credit to enrol in Level III courses.
