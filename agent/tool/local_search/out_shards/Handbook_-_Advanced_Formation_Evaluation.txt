This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles, concepts, and techniques behind (1) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology and (2) borehole imaging. NMR technology provides a method to characterize various saturated porous systems ranging from reservoir rocks to cement and concrete materials in the context of laboratory and field well logging applications. The second component of the course is dedicated to well-logging imaging techniques (optical, acoustic and electrical). Students will learn advanced approaches to characterize fracture networks and develop high-resolution reservoir models in the context of geotechnical, hydrological, and mining applications.
