The UNSW Master of Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) develops your skills in analysing, formulating and evaluating public policy, and engaging effectively with the policy process. The program is oriented to the practice of policy in all areas, including advocacy, advising and public administration. You will be encouraged to reflect on your own experiences working in policy-related fields across the public sector, community organisations or business. You will explore the role of evidence in policy making and develop an understanding of how social research is utilised by decision-makers. You will apply contemporary policy theories and frameworks to analyse policy development, and consider the importance of power, politics, ideology and influence in shaping policy outcomes. You will develop an understanding of issues of accountability and integrity in public governance, and critically examine current practices in Australia and elsewhere around the world. A key feature of the degree is the opportunity it provides to develop policy-relevant communication skills, including designing activist campaigns, writing submissions and briefs and developing persuasive arguments. The program explores contemporary case studies of policy making in the real world, and is taught by policy experts with practitioner experience.
