Design Collaboration Studio 1 is the introductory studio for the Bachelor of Design program and its three specialisations in Integrated Design, Industrial Design, and Computational Design. This studio course invites you to imagine a future where you will position yourself as an agent of change. There will be an emphasis on the fundamental methods and technical skills needed to explore opportunities, ideate, iterate, and communicate your ideas as meaningful design scenarios. You will be introduced to the enriching experience of working creatively and collaboratively towards design practices that are discipline-informed, inquisitive, and open to challenging the status quo. At the completion of this studio, you will have started to establish yourself as an emerging designer who will take action to contribute positively to our shared future.
