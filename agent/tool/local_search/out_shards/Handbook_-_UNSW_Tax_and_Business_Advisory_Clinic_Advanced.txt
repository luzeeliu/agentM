TABL3333 is an advanced course available to high-performing students upon successful completion of TABL3033 UNSW Tax and Business Advisory Clinic. The Clinic offers free accounting and tax advisory services to individuals and small businesses in serious financial hardship.
Students undertake an internship with the UNSW Tax and Business Advisory Clinic team for a number of full days (9am-5pm), support academic staff in leading seminars and are given advanced opportunities and strategic responsibilities.
Under the supervision of CA/CPA/IPA-qualified clinical supervisors, students continue gaining hands-on experience undertaking work for real clients with an emphasis on particularly complex matters.
