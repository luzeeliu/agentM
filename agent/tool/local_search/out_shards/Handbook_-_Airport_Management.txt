This course provides an in-depth understanding of the key issues within the airport management context including the regulatory environment, licensing and obligations; an evaluation of various ownership models; the economics of running the airport as a commercial business, including costs, revenues, subsidies and key performance indicators to evaluate performance; customer relationships - especially the importance of the airport-airline relationship and in how airport route marketing helps set the airport for growth. The modern airport manager is no longer someone with just a skillset in operations. Today’s airport manager is someone who can contribute to the ongoing rapid growth of non-traditional airport commercial activity and commercial revenue streams, especially in understanding the growth and importance of non-aeronautical revenue. Lastly, the shifting focus in airports deploying greater technology and how this translates to improved guest and customer experience provided within their terminals and airports, is also given focus.
