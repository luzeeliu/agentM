This Level 2 core course in Materials Science and Engineering introduces students to the principles and applications of the main analysis techniques for characterising the structure and composition of crystalline and amorphous materials.
The course covers topics on specimen preparation, crystallography, diffraction theory, and associated diffraction and scattering techniques, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, spectroscopy, image analysis, and methods for quantifying microstructural features.  Laboratory classes complement the lectures to equip students with basic practical skills in specimen preparation and operation of selected characterisation instruments and related software, as well as cultivating safe working practices in the laboratory.
The course will provide the intellectual framework for other core and elective courses that require knowledge of the structure-property relationships in materials.
This course is a core component of the BE(Hons) (Materials Science and Engineering) program and the Materials Science Major of the BSc and BAdvSci(Hons) programs. It is also suitable for science and engineering students who need a fundamental understanding and practical skills in the characterisation of materials.
The course includes weekly lectures, self-learning online activities, and in-person laboratory classes.
Previous knowledge of introductory materials science and engineering is recommended.
