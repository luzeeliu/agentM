Creating Your Career: Employability for the Future
covers four principal topics:
Understanding yourself and developing your employability
Researching career opportunities and organisations now and into the future
Using career development competencies to create your career
Communicating your professional point of difference.
Research has consistently highlighted the competitive nature of the graduate recruitment process.  Results from the 2018 Australian Association of Graduate Employers Survey showed that major graduate employers receive over 1,000 applications each year.
While academic performance is important, the majority of graduate employers rated teamwork, cultural fit and interpersonal skills as “very important” - much higher ratings than academic grades. In 2018, the next most valued attributes were communication, motivational fit and problem solving skills. The transferable skills developed outside the classroom in community engagement, casual work and relevant work placements are the major factors that differentiate the best candidates. All of this evidence suggests the need for students to strive for a balance between university and other activities as well as the need to develop employability skills as part of the university experience.
Within the course, students self-assess, reflect on and develop their employability skills in line with current and future industry expectations.
