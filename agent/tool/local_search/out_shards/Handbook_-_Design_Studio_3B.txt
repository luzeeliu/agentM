This studio course will highlight the necessity for a refined design process within a commercial framework. You will gain further experience in applying research and design methodologies to produce outcomes that address technical and manufacturing constraints while at the same time prioritising social, consumer and market needs. Each undertaking has a strong emphasis on innovation, technical resolution and high-level design documentation to a professional standard. A rigorous and responsible approach to product design is fostered by addressing real-world consumer, environmental, social, commercial, technological and manufacturing needs.
