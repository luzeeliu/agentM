This postgraduate course introduces you to recent histories and contexts that inform the major themes of contemporary art. The course locates art practices within wider social, cultural, political, and philosophical contexts, and introduces the histories of postmodernism, feminism, globalisation, decolonisation and other major frameworks that continue to shape contemporary art. The course focuses on art practices since the 1960s and examines how the rise of installation, performance and conceptual art have influenced the breakdown of traditional discipline boundaries. You will develop critical visual analysis skills through discursive tutorial activities, academic reading, writing and research tasks. You will be encouraged to work collaboratively to develop and share your analytic and reflective skills. This course will provide you with the background knowledge required to undertake independent creative enquiry in your chosen field.
