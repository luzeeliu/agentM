Note: MDCN8888 (8UoC) is a course selected in either Term 1 or 2 run concurrently with your chosen advanced course.
The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this course is centred on BSc (Med) Hons students taking on the role of researcher. In doing so, they develop advanced disciplinary knowledge, the use of specialised techniques/methodology relevant to their chosen research area, critical thinking, evaluation and synthesis of information, in addition to scientific research communication in the oral and written forms.
The principal form of teaching is based on research supervision and direction by specialist researchers within UNSW Medicine. Complementary to this, online Research Skills modules will be delivered and have been designed to provide training to BSc (Med) Hons students in diverse areas that constitute research practice. Learning outcomes from this course will form the basis for future pursuits in medical research and transferrable skills.
The information for this course is in the form of experimental techniques, protocols, technical tips and materials, which are usually provided by each laboratory and supervisor. In addition, self-directed use of other resources such as web-based sources are expected. You will need to maintain consistent communication with your supervisor and actively seek assistance from your supervisor or co-supervisor to clarify your understanding, as required.
