As foreign investment continues to increase, the number of investment disputes is also on the rise, making it important to understand the legal instruments and mechanisms in place to resolve these disputes between foreign investors and host governments. This course aims to examine the key aspects of investment dispute resolution, addressing various modes of resolution at both national and international levels. It provides a comprehensive examination of mechanisms for investor-State dispute settlement under arbitral facilities, covering a wide range of topics from jurisdiction, applicable law, interpretation, arbitral procedure, to control mechanisms and enforcement of arbitral awards. Additionally, it examines the prospects and challenges of investor-state mediation, along with other innovations. The course examines the interactions between investor-State dispute resolution and a diverse array of other issues and concepts that frequently emerge in investment disputes, such as state contracts, investment treaties, health, environment, and human rights issues.
