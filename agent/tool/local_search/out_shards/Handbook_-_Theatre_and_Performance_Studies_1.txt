This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The Theatre and Performance Studies major specialisation will enable you to engage with a wide range of performance modes - theatrical and cultural, European and Australasian, contemporary and historical, text and non-text based, low and high culture - and to experience a combination of both practice-based and concept-driven learning. As a Theatre and Performance Studies student you will be equipped with the skills to analyse, interpret or work with a variety of performance forms as well as have the opportunity to follow a chosen area of specialisation within the major. The specialisation's contemporary focus explores experimental live arts, multimedia and dance practices as well as their political and social attributes within a global context. Its historical orientation will ground you with essential skills in playtext and genre analysis as well as with perspectives on national theatre traditions and canon formation. The major's offerings in creative practice will develop the skills you need to become a theatre practitioner and include courses in interdisciplinary collaboration, professional production, script-writing and solo performance. The specialisation's professionalising pathway offers internships and arts reviewing courses which emphasise links to Sydney-based production companies, venues and publishing networks. Our major specialisation is designed to critically and creatively engage you in the social, ethical and practical state of the contemporary performing arts from a range of historical and cultural perspectives.
