A major in Economics will teach you to think like an economist.  Economists are social scientists who aim to understand human decision-making and use that understanding to achieve positive outcomes for people in complex, real-world settings.  In business, economic reasoning is used to make strategic decisions related to marketplace positioning, contracting, and production.  In governments in Australia and overseas, economic reasoning shows people in power how to craft institutions and policies that maximise human welfare.
With its intellectually rich history and rigorous pragmatism, economics is the language of power and policy.  A major in Economics prepares you to solve complex problems in business and government using concepts, skills, and approaches underpinned by time-tested principles.  Your training in this major will develop your technical, analytical, and interpretational skills, and your ability to communicate effectively to diverse audiences.  You will graduate prepared for an exciting career addressing important social and/or financial issues in business, government, academia, entrepreneurship, or politics.
