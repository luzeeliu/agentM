Gender and racial justice should be fundamental goals for all societies and yet can remain elusive.  This course explores the many and complex intersections of gender, race and justice in settler-colonial societies. In exploring these themes there will be a strong emphasis on the works of Indigenous theorists and writers thinking from within and about settler colonial systems of law and justice. The centring of the perspectives of gendered and racialised populations is a key element of the decolonial and interdisciplinary approach taken in this course.
Classes will be structured around in-depth discussions questions and group activities which will require students to have read set materials before class.  The reading material which will be theoretical, conceptual and case studies, will point to gaps in race and gender justice and create opportunities for students to imagine ways of redressing these.
Topics covered may include:
Settler colonialism
Feminism/s
critical Indigenous perspectives
Incarceration
Policing
Domestic Servitude
Social Movements: #SayHerName #MeToo
Decriminalising abortion
Justice Reinvestment
Abolitionist perspectives on race and gender justice
The course provides a sound foundation for further study and for informing practice in criminal justice/legal systems across urgent issues of gender and race justice.
