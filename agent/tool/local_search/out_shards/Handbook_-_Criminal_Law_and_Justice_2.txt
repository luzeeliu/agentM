Criminology
Criminal Law and Justice 2 (CRIM2021) builds on the themes introduced in Criminal Law and Justice 1 (CRIM2020). In this course you will examine selected crimes, their legal definition and the policy contexts in which they operate. The legal definition of crime happens formally through the pronouncements of legislatures and courts: but it also happens through the operation of the criminal justice process. In CRIM2021 you will focus on the processes by which police, prosecutors and courts deal with crime. In addition, you will consider further how legal definitions, criminal justice practice and competing policy priorities are interconnected. In particular, you will scrutinize the ways in which laws are applied, and also change over time, in relation to issues such as illicit drugs and assault.
