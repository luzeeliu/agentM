This course will be delivered in two parts. Part one is focused on ground energy and ground source heat pump systems, common design parameters and approaches and available analytical solutions to understand the concept of geothermal systems. To better understand the physics and governing equations involved in ground energy systems the interactions between the systems and the surrounding ground, the educational finite element software COMSOL will be used to computationally model different cases of ground energy systems.
The second part of the course covers the basic principles of critical state soil mechanics and soil plasticity, and the use of elastic-plastic constitutive models to simulate soil stress-strain behaviour. Students will learn to use elastic-plastic soil models to solve geotechnical engineering problems.
