Description
This course provides an overview of energy related issues in the built environment - demand and supply solutions, technologies and infrastructure, greenhouse emissions, transportation - and energy related interactions with other aspects of sustainable development. Various systems and tools for assessing and rating the performance of the built environment are introduced and explored. The course also discusses related policy, planning, design, management and technological strategies as applied at different scales in the built environment, drawing on best practice 'real world' case studies. The course is constructed around a series of lectures, readings and research assignments; assessment is based on both individual and group work.
