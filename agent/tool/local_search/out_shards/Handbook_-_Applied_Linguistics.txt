Applied Linguistics is an interdisciplinary field which investigates language-related phenomena in society. The Master of Applied Linguistics provides a theoretical and empirically-informed basis for a variety of practical applications, including the teaching and learning of foreign languages, teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), translating and interpreting, intercultural communication, language policy and planning, measuring language proficiency, and diagnosing language disorders. The degree is useful for professionals working in a wide range of fields, including those working with linguistically and culturally diverse populations (such as in education, law, psychology and medicine) and those working to provide support for migrant, transient and indigenous communities. The degree will benefit professionals working with text and discourse, including designing language curricula, language and literacy programs, developing computational applications for speech recognition and production, and those working on the design and implementation of language policy. The Master of Applied Linguistics (MAppLing) will equip you with a strong theoretical, practical and research-based understanding of the field. The program is designed to build, extend and deepen your skills, knowledge and understanding of language and linguistics in professionally relevant fields of study and to develop your skills in analytic thinking and research.
Teaching strategies and rationale
The Master of Applied Linguistics (MAppLing) program has three different streams depending on your existing qualifications: the 1 year stream (A) requires completion of 48 units of credit over 1 year of full-time enrolment (or part-time equivalent); the 1.7 year stream (B) requires completion of 72 units of credit over 1.5 years of full-time enrolment (or part-time equivalent); and the 2 year stream (C) requires completion of 96 units of credit over 2 years of full-time enrolment (or part-time equivalent). Please see below for more information on entry requirements.
