The main goal of this course is to provide you with a set of tools and knowledge that would enable you to critically read recent research papers and conduct your own original research in industrial organisation. In particular, we investigate how firms exercise market power in a variety of settings and how the government may curb the negative side effects of this through regulation. We will develop rigorous theoretical models maintaining their close connections to reality, elaborate on the economic logic and intuition behind the analyses, and discuss real-world implications. The course emphasises the importance of a theoretical understanding of strategic behaviour as the foundation for any practical application to industry.
