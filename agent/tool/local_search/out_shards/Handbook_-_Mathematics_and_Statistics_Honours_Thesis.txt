This course is only available to students enrolled in an Honours Program in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and enrolment must be approved by the School’s Honours Coordinator.
This course is taken three times over three consecutive terms (3 x 6 UoC for a total of 18 UoC). It forms the thesis component of the honours streams for programs within the School of Mathematics and Statistics. The three instances of the course form part of the one thesis/project.
For the thesis component, a student will undertake independent study in the appropriate area of applied mathematics, pure mathematics, physical oceanography, or statistics according to their honours stream. The student will be supervised by at least one member of the academic staff of the School of Mathematics and Statistics, possibly jointly with an academic external to the School, or, with the permission of the Head of School, a suitable other person in a non-university research position. The student will write a thesis and give an oral presentation on the thesis to the appropriate department.
Regular honours meetings will be timetabled as part of the thesis courses. The main purpose of these meetings is to provide a forum for honours students to give an oral presentation of their work to, and receive feedback from, their peers, the honours coordinators and their supervisor(s). The meetings will also be used for other honours training purposes, such how to use and access mathematical and statistical literature, research methodology in mathematics and statistics and how to write mathematics and statistics.
The thesis will be assessed on four major areas:
exposition, literature coverage, critical analysis and insight originality.
The weighting of these components will depend on the type of thesis, as determined by discussion between the student and supervisor(s) when the topic is chosen. All theses are expected to address all four areas.
