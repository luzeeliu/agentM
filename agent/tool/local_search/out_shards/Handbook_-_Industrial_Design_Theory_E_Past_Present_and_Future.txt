Industrial Design Theory E: Past, Present, and Future provides you with an in-depth exploration of the history and evolution of industrial design, equipping you with critical insights into the cultural, technological, and societal impact of the discipline. You will trace the progression of industrial design from the Industrial Revolution to the digital age, examining key movements such as the Arts and Crafts Movement and the Bauhaus era. You will explore how these movements have influenced and responded to changing global contexts, blending perspectives from Western and non-Western traditions to highlight the worldwide significance of design. Through interactive lectures, discussions, and creative projects, you will connect historical knowledge with contemporary and future design challenges, enabling you to apply this understanding to your own design practice.
