This course is a graduate level overview of the mathematical foundations of inverse modelling and prediction and their application to real-world systems, primarily the ocean and atmosphere. The scientific emphasis is on the formal testing of models, formulated as rigorous hypotheses about the errors in all the information: dynamics, initial conditions, boundary conditions and data. Applications in meteorology, oceanography, and climate are presented in detail.
Please note: Some computing experience (R, Fortran, Maple, Matlab, or Python) is strongly recommended for this course.
