Have you ever wondered how athletes can use advanced tools to analyse their movements to improve performance? How Lord of the Rings or Avatar were created? Or how advances in wearable technology, phone apps and smart garments can be used to detect, analyse and predict injuries and health outcomes? And even be used to help people with Parkinson's disease walk with confidence?
If these questions intrigue you, then this course is for you. This course introduces you to the methods used in the analysis of human movement across various fields such as sports, medicine, health, and entertainment. It includes applications in sport biomechanics and musculoskeletal modelling, providing a comprehensive understanding of how the human body moves and functions. You will be introduced to methods and software to analyse body segment and joint kinematics, joint kinetics, work and power, muscle forces and the associated energy cost.
Through this course, you will gain a deep understanding of the mechanical principles that govern human movement and learn how to apply this knowledge in real-world contexts. Whether you’re interested in improving athletic performance, creating lifelike animations, developing health-focused wearable technology, or advancing medical treatments, this course will equip you with the knowledge and skills you need.
Join us in exploring the fascinating world of the human body’s mechanics and discover how you can make a difference in sports, health, entertainment, and more.
