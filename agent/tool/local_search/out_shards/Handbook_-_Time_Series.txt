The course is concerned with the theory and application of appropriate statistical techniques for analysis of time series data -- data collected over time. The course will help students develop a sound understanding of stationary and non-stationary time series models and their properties in discrete time. The topics include the theory of stationary time series; methods for trend and seasonal analysis and adjustment; modelling and forecasting with autoregressive moving average processes; modelling the impact of exogenous or intervention variables on responses; models for stochastic volatility and long-term dependence; regression models for time series. Applications are primarily drawn from finance and public health and the R software environment is used to perform appropriate analyses for numerical examples.

Assumed knowledge: Students are expected to be familiar with the basic principles of Probability and Statistics, including: random variables and their characteristics (mean, variance, covariance, and correlation); estimators and their properties (bias, variance, consistency, asymptotic distribution); the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem; and the methods of moments and maximum likelihood estimation.
In addition, a basic knowledge of Real Analysis is assumed. This includes understanding functions and their properties, limits and series, differentiation and integration, Taylor expansions, and function spaces. Students should also be familiar with complex numbers and their basic characteristics, as well as complex-valued functions.
Students can contact the course authority for advice regarding assumed knowledge.
