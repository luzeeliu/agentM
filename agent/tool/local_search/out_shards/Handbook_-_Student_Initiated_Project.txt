This fourth year elective course allows students to deliver a project, of their design, that engages the strength of cross-disciplinary student teams. Students will develop, manage, solve and report on a project, or solve a significant problem, that they initiate. The course develops project and planning skills and introduces student to the concept of 'success' criteria and 'failure' criteria. The project requires that students work in cross-disciplinary teams with the skill-set required to undertake identified tasks.
It is expected that teams will consist of four students crossing a minimum of three different discipline skill sets across single or dual engineering degrees. Teams of more than four students may be approved subject to a determination that the team skills match the project need and that skills are not excessively duplicated.
