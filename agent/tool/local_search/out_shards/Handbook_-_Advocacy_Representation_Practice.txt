In recent decades the world has seen the role of government shrink dramatically. This has left a huge hole in the provision of social services; a gap filled by a rapidly growing not-for-profit sector. This sector requires a unique brand of communications centred around representing and speaking on behalf of those who often don’t have a public voice. Accordingly, a specific and multifaceted set of communication skills is required. This course will equip you with such a skill set. You will receive the knowledge and tools necessary for the development of nuanced, ethical, and effective communication programs that speak to principles of social equity and inclusion. You will therefore be positioned to strive for policy change in a vast array of arenas from public health, social services and immigration through to foreign relations, climate change and third-world development.
