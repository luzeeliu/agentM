Low Rise Building Construction covers a detailed discussion of the procedures for commercial and residential projects adopted in Australia. This course examines the various components of a low rise building, including foundations, floors, walls, roofs, stairs, services and material finishes. You will learn how to plan, design and construct typical low rise construction projects, emphasising the appropriate evaluation of building components to incorporate into the building, which must comply with Australian standards and the National Construction Code (NCC). During the course, you will have the opportunity to analyse and assess a variety of architectural, structural, and construction drawings commonly found in low rise construction projects. This experience will help you enhance your construction plan interpretation and drawing skills. The course will also introduce you to the concept of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) to select and contrast between applicable construction materials adopted in low rise construction projects to ensure that sustainability principles are adopted.
