This handbook entry is for students commencing their studies from 2024. Please refer to previous editions of the handbook for pre-2024 requirements.
The field of Materials Science and Engineering presents an incredible opportunity for innovation and progress.
The field impacts almost every aspect of our daily lives, such as the remarkable recycled products produced from seemingly end-of-life waste materials, the ubiquitous concrete and steel in the structures all around us, the novel materials needed for improving the performance of rechargeable batteries, and the amazing biomedical materials that improve our health and extend our life.  In this century, sustainability, environmental impact, and the ongoing quest to improve our health and standard of living, lie at the core of materials development and application.
The UNSW Bachelor of Engineering (honours) in Materials Science and Engineering is one of the most contemporary degrees of its kind in Australia, with a strong emphasis on societal impact.  The early stages cover the fundamental scientific principles necessary for understanding the structure, properties, and performance of all major classes of materials, including metallic, ceramic, polymeric, composite, and nature-inspired materials. The focus then shifts towards the principles involved in designing, selecting and processing materials for use in applications that positively impact the world around us.
Ultimately, the degree program, which requires students to select two societal materials electives, two general electives from outside the discipline, and two free electives from any discipline, cultivates the necessary professional and socially aware mindset required for a successful career as a materials engineer.
The School of Materials Science and Engineering is ideally positioned to train the next generation of materials engineering graduates who are passionate about making a positive difference to the world.  The School boasts a team of leading educators and state-of-the-art facilities for teaching, computing, and materials processing, characterization, and properties.  These resources provide students with an exceptional education and training environment, preparing them for careers in various sectors, including aerospace, transportation, defence, construction, mining, electronics, renewable energy, and biomedical science.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.

Professional Recognition
Engineers Australia recognises the degree of BE as meeting the examination requirements for admission to graduate and corporate membership. Similarly, substantial or complete recognition is accorded to the BE degree programs by overseas engineering institutions.
Recognition of Achievement
Expand all
University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
Recognition of achievement for Honours in the program is as follows
:
Class 1: Honours WAM >80 and Thesis mark of >65
Class 2 Division 1: Honours WAM >75 and Thesis mark of >65
Class 2 Division 2: Honours WAM >65 and Thesis mark of >65
The Honours WAM is calculated to one decimal place as a weighting of courses according to UOC and the particular level, the latter being:
General Education = 1
Level 1 Courses =  1
Level 2 Courses =  2
Level 3 Courses =  3
Level 4 Courses =  4
Only the first attempt at a course counts.
The above weighing reflects the embedded Honours model of the program and a significant research project (18 or 24 UOC) is included in the final year of study.
Additional Information
