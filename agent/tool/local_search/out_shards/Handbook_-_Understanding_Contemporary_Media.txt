This course introduces theories and practices related to data in the contemporary media landscape. It focusses on the use of data by contemporary media practitioners to produce engaging stories, algorithmic decision making, and tracking and predicting audience engagement. You will be introduced to key concepts that frame, assist and critically challenge practitioners working with data in the contemporary media and communication fields. Through reflection, analysis and production of data projects, the course will help you develop critical views on contemporary data practices and their application to talk about the pressing issues of our times including but not limited to climate change, (neo) colonialism, algorithmic injustice and labour exploitation. The topics covered in the course will provide you with a fundamental understanding of data processes and approaches that can be used to make informed decisions on working with data.
