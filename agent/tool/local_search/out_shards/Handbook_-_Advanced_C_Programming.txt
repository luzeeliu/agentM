COMP6771 is an advanced programming course teaching practical aspects of intermediate/advanced C++ programming. The course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of C++, followed by exploring powerful abstractions that C++ enables. This course focuses on using abstractions as well as building abstractions.
COMP6771 is focused on modern, practical programming methods and tools. This course is designed for latter year CSE students with a reasonable degree of programming competencies.
The course is heavily supported by Christopher Di Bella , a UNSW CSE graduate who is a well-regarded expert on C++. His knowledge and expertise assists in forming and updating the course.
Our aim for students who complete this course satisfactorily is that they are highly competent in understanding C++ and it's core features, being able to build complex programs, data structures, and algorithms with C++, and being ready to immediately move into the workforce in areas that rely heavily on C++.
Students will need to work consistently each week to maintain progress through the course.
