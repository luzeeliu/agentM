INFS5997 Integrated Technology and Analytics Application is a Capstone course that invites you to apply business knowledge and technical skills acquired during their MCom program to tackle real-world problems. This course takes a “living lab” approach to immerse you in a project-based experiential learning environment, where you can deeply engage with and apply multi-disciplinary frameworks to develop user-centric, evidence-based digital solutions for real-world problems.
You will synthesise and apply knowledge from different key learning areas (KLAs) to identify, analyse, and frame complex business challenges, fostering a holistic approach to problem-solving. Emphasising critical thinking and innovative problem-solving, the course equips you to critically apply information systems concepts and tools to prototype effective digital solutions. These solutions aim to generate positive, impactful outcomes for stakeholders, acknowledging the vital role of responsible technology design in today's world.
Ethical considerations and sustainability are at the forefront of our approach. You will apply ethics and sustainability frameworks within an SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) context to ensure the responsible development of digital solutions. Furthermore, the course emphasises the importance of lifelong learning and personal growth, encouraging you to engage in reflective learning and recognise opportunities for continual development. This practical-oriented experiential learning will equip you with essential career-ready, whole-person skills and attributes, which are pivotal for a successful transition into the workplace.
The bootcamp and face-to-face sessions are facilitated by academic and industry mentors, who deliver Key Learning Activities (KLAs) and provide ongoing formative feedback to students on their capstone projects.
