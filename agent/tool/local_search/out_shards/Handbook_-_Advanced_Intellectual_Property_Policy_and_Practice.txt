This is a course for students who have already learned the fundamentals of intellectual property law, and who would like to extend their knowledge and practical skills in this area of law.
Policy
: The course provides opportunities to explore some contentious areas of debate and policy development within intellectual property law, such as trade mark counterfeiting and copyright piracy; issues surrounding bio-prospecting and ownership of genetic material; protection of indigenous cultural and intellectual property (‘ICIP’); and the effects of intellectual property laws on access to essential medicines.
Practice
: The course also examines practical issues intellectual property lawyers are likely to confront in practice, such as franchising; the interplay of marketing, branding and trade marks; portfolio management; criminal offences; registration practice and strategies; parallel importation; geographical indications. A choice of assessment options allows students to either extend their knowledge in a particular area of interest through a research essay, or develop their practical legal skills by advising hypothetical clients in a series of short problem question exercises known as ‘practice briefs’.
The course provides a solid general knowledge of relevant issues and skills for students wishing to practice in intellectual property law, and a good grounding in intellectual property research for students considering writing a thesis or undertaking postgraduate studies in this area.
