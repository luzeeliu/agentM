Are you preparing for a career in health, or simply keen to learn about how our bodies function in health and disease? Human Structure & Function 1 will enable you to appreciate the relationship between anatomical structures and physiological functions of the human body. You will investigate the relationships between normal structure and function in human cells, tissues, and organs, and how this applies to health maintenance and disease. The Human Structure & Function 1 course content is divided into six modules: Anatomy and Physiology Fundamentals; Integumentary System, Musculoskeletal System; Nervous System; Special Senses and Cardiovascular System. Alongside learning about these systems in the human body, you will also develop skills in research and critical analysis of the relevant literature, and communication of scientific information relevant to the study of the human body.
