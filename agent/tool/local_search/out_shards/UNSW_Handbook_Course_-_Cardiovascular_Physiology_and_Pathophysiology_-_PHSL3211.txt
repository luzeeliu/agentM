Description
An advanced course focusing on the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. The course is divided into three units. Unit One covers molecular and cellular aspects of cardiovascular tissues; the vascular endothelium, cardiac and smooth muscle and cell communication. Unit Two addresses systemic cardiovascular physiology, from capillary exchange, the microcirculation, the ECG, control of regional blood flow and hemodynamics, up to regulation of cardiac output and blood pressure and the function of the cardiovascular system in exercise. Unit Three focuses on the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system, with lectures delivered by leading researchers in the fields of atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension and gene-targeted approaches to combating cardiovascular disease. Lecture-based material is complemented by practical classes and problem-based learning.
