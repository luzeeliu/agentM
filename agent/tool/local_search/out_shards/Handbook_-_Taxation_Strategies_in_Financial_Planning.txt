This is an essential course for professionals involved in the provision of financial advice.  The course examines common strategies used in financial planning to achieve optimal after-tax outcomes for individuals.  After covering the interplay between taxation and financial planning, the course investigates specific tax concessions available to enhance the accumulation of private wealth via strategic investments in property, equities, superannuation, and alternative investments.  Specifically, the course explores tax-related strategies including negative gearing, tax-aware investment management, main residence exemption, small business CGT concessions, estate planning and employee remuneration packaging.  Building on foundational knowledge of the taxation of superannuation, the course also analyses how superannuation related tax concessions can be used strategically to maximise retirement savings.  Through a practical approach, students will gain essential insights into how these tax strategies can be integrated to enhance investment efficiency.
