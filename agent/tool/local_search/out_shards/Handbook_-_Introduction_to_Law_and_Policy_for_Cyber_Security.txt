This course offers an introduction to law and policy issues in cyber security for postgraduate students who do not have a primary degree in Law. It introduces relevant core concepts (including regulation, common law and statute) and doctrines (including tort and contract), with a specific focus on the cyber context. Relevant legislation in areas such as privacy, telecommunications, critical infrastructure, criminal law, national security and law enforcement are analysed to understand how they might affect the behaviour of both attackers and defenders. The focus is on Australian law, but comparative material is included where relevant, particularly where it impacts Australian industry. Topical matters in international law are also explored.
