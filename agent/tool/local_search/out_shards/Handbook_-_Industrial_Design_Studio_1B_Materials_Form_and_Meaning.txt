This course familiarizes you with the principles and processes that guide the selection, application and specification of colour, materials, and material finishes in the design of aesthetically engaging products. In this course, you will enhance your creative skills and continue to develop an iterative design process based on the industrial design methodology. The course will challenge you to investigate colour, form, and texture through the drawing, material experimentation, and model-making techniques that industrial designers typically engage in. Through project-based assessments, you will conceive of simple products that convey a visual and tactile approach to product design that responds to the emotional and operational contexts of user experience. You will develop the presentation skills necessary to communicate design concepts and document technical detail for discussion with clients and collaborators.
