Chemical and environmental engineering are concerned with sustainably meeting human needs through the application of science and technology, as well as understanding how humanity engages and interacts with raw materials and the environment. In doing so, it is critical to reduce demand for energy and resources, prevent pollution and minimise waste. Each of these actions requires an understanding of how material and energy move through natural and chemical processes.
In this course, you will master the foundational principles of material and energy balances, and mass transfer. Through this course you will develop the ability to analyse chemical and other processes whether they involve one or several unit operations, chemical reactions or phase changes, mixing or separation, or recycle, bypass or purge streams. In addition, you will learn how mass transfer mechanisms such as diffusion and convection for fixed and free interfaces, and in one to three dimensions, can be used to explain the movement of material in processes and the environment.
