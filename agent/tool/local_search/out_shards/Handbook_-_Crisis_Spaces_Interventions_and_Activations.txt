In this course you will explore and interrogate spatial interventions and the role they can play in the prevention and response to crises. Surveying, selecting, and researching a critical issue
,
you will investigate how the crisis can be either mitigated, or the needs of the community assisted, through a designed intervention.
Across two assessment tasks, you will undertake an in-depth study into your selected crisis, its broader context, the stakeholders affected and any current solutions. In response to this research and through an iterative process you will propose and prototype new interventions of both a preventative and curative or remedial nature.
With the intention of using your design skills to make a difference in critical times, the course presents you with a broad range of case studies from wearables to parasitic architecture and challenges you to consider and design solutions to urgent global issues.
