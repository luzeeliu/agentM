Stream Outline
This Genetics major offers a general introduction to the discipline during the first years of study and then allows students to diversify into the more specialised areas of genetics, including molecular genetics, human genetics, plant and microbial molecular biology, conservation biology, etc. Molecular biology has had a major impact on this discipline and is ideal for those students whose interests are in understanding and appreciating biological processes at the molecular rather than the descriptive level. The study of genetics has taken a more computer/systems approach and the major has a significant focus in this discipline integration of these approaches at the cellular, whole organism and population level.
