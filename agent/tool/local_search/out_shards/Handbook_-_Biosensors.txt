From designing wearable glucose monitors for diabetes management to developing lab-on-a-chip technologies for personalised medicine, biosensors are revolutionising the field of physiological measurement and clinical diagnostics. This course focuses on the design, development, and application of sensors for measuring physiological variables. It covers a wide range of biosensing technologies, including electrical, mechanical, chemical, and biological sensors, while emphasising their practical use in real-world scenarios.
You will explore the principles and mechanisms governing the acquisition and processing of physiological signals, both
in vivo
and
in vitro
, through hands-on labs, design projects, and case studies. You will learn to develop and implement measurement devices and approaches, ensuring compliance with safety standards.
By the end of the course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the biosensor landscape, from the underlying science to the practical applications, and be equipped with the skills to contribute to this rapidly evolving field. Whether you aspire to innovate in the medical technology industry, conduct research in biomedical engineering, or simply gain a deeper understanding of biosensors, this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve your goals.
