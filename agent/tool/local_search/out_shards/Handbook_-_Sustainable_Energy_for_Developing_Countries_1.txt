Energy services are critical for health and livelihoods, while enabling productive activities and economic prosperity. However, more than a billion people around the world in rural areas and urban slums do not have access to these services and infrastructure. Many projects and programs in rural areas of developing countries, fragile states, communities in disaster recovery and other disadvantaged communities aim to improve access to modern energy services. A range of renewable energy technologies, from small and appliance-integrated to utility-scale, are available to deliver these services cost-effectively. However, delivery of these interventions presents a range of technical, economic, social and institutional challenges. The aims of this course are to:
Introduce students to many of the technical and nontechnical issues related to the delivery of accessible, affordable and appropriate energy services and infrastructure in developing countries and other disadvantaged communities.
Develop and apply skills and approaches for assessing, designing and specifying sustainable rural energy projects. The course guides students in collection of data, technical characteristics of system components, building appropriate technical and economic models, and project planning.
There is an emphasis on understanding context, appropriate design and technology selection, implementation models and capacity building for sustainable projects.
