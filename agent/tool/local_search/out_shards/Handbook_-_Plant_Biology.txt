This course is a dynamic second-year course within the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences. It offers a comprehensive exploration of plant biology, with a focus on Australia's native flora. The course blends theoretical study with practical experience through lab work and field trips to Sydney's regional national parks. Key topics include plant identification, edible botany, plant ecology, and biogeography. Students gain hands-on experience identifying plants and understanding their adaptations to terrestrial ecosystems. These experiences offer excellent preparation for third-year courses like Advanced Field Biology (BIOS3601), Life in Arid Lands (BIOS3161), and Plant Ecology (BIOS3061). Potential students should note the course includes mandatory field trips during class time and lab work. BIOS2051 is an excellent choice for those aiming for careers in botany, environmental science, or broader biological fields.
