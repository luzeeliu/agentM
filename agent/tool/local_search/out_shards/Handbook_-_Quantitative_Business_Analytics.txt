Quantitative business analytics empower business decision makers to analyse complex business problems, and make better and faster decisions. It is an essential skill for an analyst in all business disciplines to use modern analytical tools and quantitative techniques. This course aims to provide students with quantitative techniques used in business analytics, with a particular focus on practical applications of modelling skills and analytical tools (e.g. using R). The course focuses on how to select appropriate predictive modelling techniques for a stated situation and how to evaluate the suitability of a model, taking into account business context and objectives. The course covers topics including regression techniques and classification methods, model selection and validation methods, linear and non-linear models, decision trees, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and ethical, social and regulatory issues associated with quantitative analytics. A particular focus will be placed on communication of technical results to a wide range of business decision making audiences.
