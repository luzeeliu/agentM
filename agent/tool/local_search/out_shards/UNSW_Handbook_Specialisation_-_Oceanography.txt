Oceanography
Description
The study of Oceanography within School of Mathematics and Statistics is concerned primarily with the mathematical equations that describe fluid flow, and how these are used in understanding the ocean. The discipline is also concerned with the measurement, modeling and prediction of processes that form the oceanic system of the planet (coupled with the atmospheric system). A range of careers are available in Oceanography in research, operational and managerial capacities.
Studying Oceanography at UNSW
Students with a strong interest in Mathematics way wish to study Oceanography through a Bachelor of Science or Advanced Science (Honours) degree program, where there is a strong theoretical emphasis. Those students who desire a more general understanding of oceanography in its relation to marine and coastal studies may wish to undertake a Marine Science major within the Science program, where Oceanography still forms an important element. UNSW also offers the study of Oceanography at a postgraduate level.
