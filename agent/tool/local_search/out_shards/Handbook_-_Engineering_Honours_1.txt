The UNSW Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) is designed to equip you for a career as a professional engineer. We provide you with a solid background in mathematics, natural sciences and computing that will prepare you for learning knowledge and skills in an engineering discipline specialisation. You will get the chance to apply yourself to engineering design and enquiry projects, professional engineering practice, engineering and technical management and conduct research towards your thesis project.
The four year program is offered in 21 engineering specialisations (listed below). A flexible first year engineering specialisation is offered for students who wish to study engineering but choose to delay their choice of which branch of engineering to study until the end of Year 1.
