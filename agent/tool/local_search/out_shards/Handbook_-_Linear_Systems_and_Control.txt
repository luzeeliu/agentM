This course aims to introduce students to the fundamental principles of control theory for dynamic systems. It provides an overview of modelling, feedback control, and stability analysis as the essential foundation for designing control systems for a wide variety of applications, such as stability control, fluid flow control, and temperature regulation.
Throughout the course, students will learn key concepts and tools for system design and analysis, including: ordinary differential equations, linearisation techniques, Laplace transforms, transfer functions, block diagrams, transient and steady-state response of first and second-order systems, poles and zeros, the concept of system stability, root locus, Bode plots, PID control, state space models (SISO and MIMO systems), state feedback control, state observers, controllability and observability.
This course is designed for students in Aerospace, Mechanical, and Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, and incorporates a wide range of examples from various engineering disciplines.
