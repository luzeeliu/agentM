This introductory course provides you with opportunities to develop foundational skills and knowledge that you will build on throughout the Animation and Moving Image specialisation of the Bachelor of Fine Arts program.
The course offers you an opportunity to experience broad areas of digital and screen-based practice to understand their interplay and your potential future pathways. The course progresses from digital image to moving image production, incorporating aspects of digital manipulation, and culminates in the production of projects that utilise the approaches, techniques and methods introduced in the course.
Course activities are designed to develop your skills in the production of screen aesthetics, as well as skills of critical discussion and reflection in a supportive and collaborative studio environment.
