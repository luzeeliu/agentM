Description
This course will provide a capstone experience for students undertaking a psychology major. That is, the learning, teaching and assessment strategies will provide students with the opportunity to integrate disparate learnings from previous courses in psychology, so that they have some sense of the overall knowledge, skills and professional dispositions (psychology graduate attributes, i.e., psychological literacy) that they have acquired. Psychological research and its applications will be considered in a broad historical, ethical and cultural context. In the further development of psychological literacy, the application of psychological principles to self, others and society will be emphasised.
