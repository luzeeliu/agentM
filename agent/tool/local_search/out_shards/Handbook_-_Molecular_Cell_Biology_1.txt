Cells are not only the basic building blocks of all organisms, they are also the source of the vast diversity that characterises life on earth. This course provides an opportunity to explore the nature of cells, both the unity and the breadth of cell structure and function, from bacteria to eukaryotes. It builds on the introduction contained in BABS1201. The major topics covered include: the cell cycle and the processes that regulate entry into, transition through, and exit from the cycle; mitosis, meiosis, cyclins and CDKss, apoptosis and cancer; cellular integrity and movement; interactions of cells with each other and their environment, signaling pathways, immunology, chemotaxis and sensing, biofilm formation and interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Practical work during laboratory sessions illustrates and extends the lectures. Tutorials are designed to reinforce the lecture material and to emphasise the development of writing skills, group work, and the process of scientific enquiry.
