This course addresses core philosophical questions about knowledge, reality, and human existence.  You will examine what it means for something to be true and how we know whether something is true; what are the fundamentals of the universe and the place of science and religion in discerning them; what are the basic constituents of human societies, and how all these questions are related to what and who you are. In investigating these topics we will study the views of both classical and contemporary philosophers. This course will help you develop the critical and analytical thinking skills necessary for advanced study and your future career. While this is a standalone introductory course, it can be usefully combined with ARTS1361: Mind, Ethics, and Freedom - Introduction to Philosophy.
