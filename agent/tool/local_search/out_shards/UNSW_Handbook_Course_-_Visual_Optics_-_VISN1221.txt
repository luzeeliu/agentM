Description
This course is concerned with the optics of the eye and the optical factors associated with vision.  Measurement and   correction of refractive errors with spectacle lenses and contact lenses forms a major component of the course. Ophthalmic optics is introduced. The course also includes the principles of radiometry, photometry and colorimetry.
Brief Curriculum: Ametropia and its correction, optometers, accommodation, retinal image analysis, astigmatism,  the optics of subjective refraction, optics of near correction, optical factors affecting  visual resolution,  higher order aberrations, ocular correction of ametropia (contact lenses and implant lenses), introduction to spectacle lenses and ophthalmic optics,  entoptic phenomena,   introduction to radiometry, photometry and colorimetry.
