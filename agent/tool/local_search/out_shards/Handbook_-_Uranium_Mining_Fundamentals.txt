Uranium Mining Fundamentals will cover all stages of mining, from exploration of ore geology to mine feasibility and design and mine operation. Global and Australian uranium potential and leading practices for mining uranium will be evaluated and critiqued. Mining methods considered for efficient and safe extraction of uranium will include open cut, underground and In Situ Recovery (ISR) leach methods. The fundamentals of mine geomechanics, including slope stability and ground support requirements, will be presented as part of mining method selection, along with consideration of grade control and ventilation for safe underground mining. Fundamentals of milling and chemical processing of uranium ore will be presented, focusing mostly on production to the yellow cake stage (uranium oxide powders). Technical aspects of mining and milling operations are complimented with consideration of health and safety, economic, community, environmental and regulatory issues associated with uranium mining, presented within a risk management framework.
