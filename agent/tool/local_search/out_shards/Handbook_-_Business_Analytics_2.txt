This specialisation in Business Analytics will provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to analyse and work with big data from internal and external sources. This capacity is of increasing value to organisations across all sectors, enabling them to gain insights into their organisation and its environment, and improve decision-making, innovation and agility.
Organisations have been engaged in business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) for a number of years. This specialisation will provide graduates with the capacity to undertake this key business priority. There is a significant role for professionals with an information systems perspective who understand, at a technology and organisation level, how information is captured, structured and stored, governed and kept secure, how to draw insights from the information, and how to link those insights to business strategy.
