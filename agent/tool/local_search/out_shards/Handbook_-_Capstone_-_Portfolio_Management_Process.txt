The course presents a continuous and systematic approach to the process of portfolio management. The process begins with the development of a policy statement to suit the needs, constraints and preferences of an investor. A thorough examination of past, current and projected conditions of the economy, markets, industries and companies is then conducted to form the basis for portfolio construction and implementation of investment strategy. The last stage of the process focuses on the continual evaluation of portfolio performance and monitoring of investor-related factors and economy and market input factors. The feedback obtained from this stage will serve as an impetus for portfolio rebalancing, revision of the investment policy statement and changes to asset allocation and investment strategy.
