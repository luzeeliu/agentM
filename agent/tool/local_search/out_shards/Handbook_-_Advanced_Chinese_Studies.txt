Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.

Additional Information
Placement Information
The School of Humanities and Languages offers a flexible program for students with different interests and different Chinese language backgrounds. You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.
If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found at:
School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements
You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as entry level courses in terms of your degree requirements.
You will be admitted to the Expert level of entry to the Minor if you have completed high school in China or have elsewhere achieved equivalent language proficiency to a Chinese high school graduate. This level emphasises Chinese Studies (contextual and professional) courses. Since you already have a high level of language proficiency and literacy in Chinese, you will enroll in Translation and Interpreting courses as Gateway language courses – which are a requirement for the minor at this entry level.
