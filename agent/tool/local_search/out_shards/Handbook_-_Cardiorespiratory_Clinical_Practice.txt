This course is specifically designed for students enrolled in the
Master of
Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology program
and introduces common conditions that affect the cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular systems. You will integrate knowledge of cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and other determinants of health to inform safe and effective exercise testing, assessment and delivery of exercise-based interventions. You will develop competency in evaluating physiological responses and adaptations to acute and chronic exercise. You will also develop skills in appropriate planning, delivery and monitoring of safe and effective exercise-based interventions for people with cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular conditions.
The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model will be used to develop clinical reasoning to plan a comprehensive evidence-based and client-centred physiotherapy assessment, treatment and evaluation plan for cardiorespiratory impairments across the lifespan. Indications, mechanisms of action and adverse effects of medication commonly used in cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular conditions will also be critically reviewed.
