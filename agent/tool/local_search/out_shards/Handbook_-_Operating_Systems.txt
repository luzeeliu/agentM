Operating systems are an essential part of computer systems, so a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science or computer engineering program. This course provides an in-depth understanding of the underlying operating systems that students have implicitly relied upon when developing applications in the foundational courses within Computer Science and Engineering. The knowledge gained will continue to be relevant to your future career when developing systems and applications.
In general terms, the course aims to educate students in the basic concepts, components and behaviours of modern monolithic operating systems,  including the relevant characteristics of hardware. Topics include processes, threads, concurrency, file systems, memory management and scheduling.
Students will apply some of the concepts learnt by implementing parts of a realistic teaching operating system.
