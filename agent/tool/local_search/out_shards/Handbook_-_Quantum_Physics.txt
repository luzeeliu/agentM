Quantum mechanics addresses the interesting wave-like quantised physical phenomena that occur at microscopic scales. The subject was a major research focus of the ‘modern physics’ revolution of the 1900s and is shaping as a key technology driver of the early 2000s. This first course in quantum mechanics provides students with a broad and comprehensive introduction to the technical fundamentals of quantum mechanics and builds a strong foundation for further studies. Topics covered include:
Angular momentum in classical and quantum limits. Quantum spin (two-level systems). Vector representation and Hilbert spaces. Bras & kets and matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Operators. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. Expectation value. Pauli matrices. Classical and quantum correlation. Entanglement. Infinite state limit and wavefunctions as states. Simultaneous observables. Commutators. Statistics of uncertainty. Uncertainty principle as a generalised concept. Developments leading up to the wave equation. Schrodinger’s equation. Wavefunctions and expectation values. Infinite and finite square potential well. Quantum harmonic oscillator. Time evolution and coherence. Fourier’s theorems and Fourier transforms. Quantum propagation of a free particle. Barriers and steps. Delta function and periodic potentials.
