Description
Emerging technologies in the areas of medical, environmental and molecular biotechnology will be discussed in the context of their potential impact on the directions of current products and services, product development, research techniques, and manufacturing processes. Students will gain an understanding of the history of biotechnology and how the background science is rapidly evolving and being commercialised to advance Australian and global socio-economic- environmental development. Through site visits to local biotechnology businesses and a team project aimed at communicating a real biotechnology related opportunity to a range of audiences (technical, lay and business), students will gain insight into the realities of how industry is structured and managed. Assessment will be based on performance in: the final examination; class presentations; and the team project.
