Is there life beyond the Earth? What do we learn from modern day telescopes and satellites? In this course, students will be introduced to the physics of the Universe from scales ranging from our Solar System and extrasolar planets to the origin and fate of the Universe, gaining an understanding and appreciation of what is known about the Universe and the techniques scientists use to make discoveries. Students will also gain experience in effectively communicating knowledge to different audiences and in how to separate science fact from science fiction.
Topics to be covered include: astronomical techniques, history of astronomy across cultures, beginnings of the Universe, formation and evolution of galaxies, origin of life on Earth and search for life elsewhere, stellar structure and evolution, planet formation, black holes, and compact objects.
This course has asynchronous lectures and no face-to-face classes. This course is intended primarily as a general education subject with no assumed prior knowledge. Students wishing to proceed on to PHYS2116 and PHYS3116, or with a good prior background in physics and astronomy, may instead wish to take PHYS1116 Astrophysics, which is a more technical version of the subject intended for physics majors and science students.
