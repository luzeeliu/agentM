Economics is about shaping a better world. It examines how people, businesses, and governments make decisions with limited resources, and how those choices affect society.
In this course, you’ll learn to “think like an economist” and apply economic reasoning to real-world challenges like climate change, inequality, poverty, and access to healthcare and education. You’ll gain tools to evaluate policies, understand who benefits (and who doesn’t), and design solutions that create positive impact.
We’ll explore questions such as:
How can growth and sustainability be balanced?
What policies reduce inequality and improve welfare?
When do markets fail, and what can governments do?
By the end, you’ll not only master core concepts but also know how to use them to tackle pressing issues. Whether your path is business, policy, or global development, economics offers powerful insights for building a fairer future.
