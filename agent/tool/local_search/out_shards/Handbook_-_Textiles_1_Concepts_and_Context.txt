This course will introduce you to the narrative aspect of textiles, and their story telling ability via patterns, materials and construction. It will familiarise you with the qualities and characteristics of textiles, as well as the key processes for designing and creating them through the integration of hand and digital design methods. You will consider social, cultural, environmental and sustainable themes that will become influential to your textile practice. Throughout the course you will employ research methodologies appropriate to the textile design industry and investigate selected textile theorists and writers to critically evaluate, document and reflect. You will investigate the local culture of textile practitioners to inspire and develop unique surface designs. In this course, you are encouraged to play, experiment and learn from failure and take creative risks in the development of cohesive conceptually-based textiles.
