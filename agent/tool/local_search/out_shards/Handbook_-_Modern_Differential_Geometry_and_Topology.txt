Topology and differential geometry both deal with the study of shape: topology from a continuous and differential geometry from a differentiable viewpoint.
This postgraduate course begins with a study of curves in the plane and in space focusing on how they bend. Surfaces are also introduced, studying the first and second fundamental forms introduced by Gauss, the various measures of curvature and what they mean for the external and internal appearance and properties of surfaces. The course also provides an opportunity to prove the important Gauss-Bonnet theorem and use it to examine topological properties of surfaces, such as the Euler Characteristic.
