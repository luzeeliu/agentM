The Employment Law clinic requires students to undertake work for real clients while providing the student with opportunities to analyse the effect of the law in practice. Through their work for disadvantaged clients on case, education and policy files students develop their understanding of substantive and procedural law and ethical issues in the area of employment. Students undertaking this Clinic will be working in a legal practice at Kingsford Legal Centre on employment law matters. Students attend the Centre two days a week, attend a weekly seminar of two hours and undertake evening and daytime public advice sessions. Students are responsible for files under the supervision of the clinical supervisor. Students  conduct interviews with clients, make strategic decisions about conduct of the file, undertake research, draft all documents and where appropriate undertake advocacy in court or tribunals for the client. A daily tutorial and weekly seminars  provide opportunities for discussion and analysis of students' experiences and for instruction and development of ethical issues, employment law, legal procedure and skills. Students undertake project work relating to legal issues. Students are encouraged to think critically about the legal system through one to one supervision by clinical supervisors.
