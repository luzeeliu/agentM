Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming marketing analytics by helping marketers better predict consumer demand, segment audiences, and uncover consumer behaviours with unprecedented precision. It is imperative for the next generation of marketing analysts to have a solid understanding of these algorithms and hands-on experience applying them to real-world marketing analytics problems. This course will cover established ML techniques—linear models (e.g., linear and logistic regression), non-linear models (e.g., decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, neural network), and model assessment and enhancement methods (e.g., crossvalidation, regularisation, ensemble learning)—as well as recent advances in AI for natural language processing (e.g., word2vec, transformer, ChatGPT) and computer vision (e.g., convolutional neural network). Throughout the term, we will use overarching case studies and datasets to demonstrate their practical applications in marketing analytics (e.g., consumer segmentation via classification prediction, customer review analysis through text mining, and consumer demographic/behaviour inference from image data analysis). This course is designed for students interested in a career as marketing analysts in the marketing industry, providing them with practical AI and ML skills to study data-driven consumer and marketing insights.
