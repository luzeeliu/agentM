This course is designed as a core course in the War Studies Master program. It will give the student comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the art of warfare by charting its evolution from early civilisation to the twentieth century, and by posing questions for its development in the contemporary world. The context of the course is mainly European and focused on professional forces, but it probes deep questions of how warfare relates to the development of civilized societies, science and technology, and the modern state. Students will gain foundational knowledge and integrated understanding of the changing practice and historical interpretation of warfare. They will benefit from the skills developed in critically evaluating the causes, course, resolution and consequences of armed conflict and how it has shaped our world.
