This course provides students with essential knowledge for managing exchange rate risk in multinational firms and financial institutions. It covers practical applications of currency forecasting, speculation, and hedging to inform international investment and financing decisions. The course offers a solid theoretical foundation in international finance, paired with hands-on experience through data analysis and scenario-based exercises.
Students begin by examining international monetary policy and foreign exchange markets from a macroeconomic perspective before studying the determinants of exchange rates. The focus then shifts to the development of hedging strategies for mitigating the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations.
With a comprehensive understanding of hedging instruments established, the course progresses to firm-level applications, exploring how multinational corporations can strategically invest and secure financing in global markets while managing associated risks.
By the end of the course, students will have a thorough grasp of the key principles and tools essential for effective global financial management.
