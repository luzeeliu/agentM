Geoenergy and Geostorage Engineering is an innovative field that intersects with the traditional domain of Petroleum Engineering. This discipline emphasizes the sustainable exploitation of earth resources, including the permanent storage of carbon dioxide, seasonal storage of hydrogen or energy, as well as the extraction of heat, energy or saline brines from the earth. The recognition of the importance of sustainable practices in the extraction and management of subsurface resources has led to the development of this specialized engineering field. It builds on the foundations of Petroleum Engineering by integrating principles of reservoir engineering, geomechanics, and environmental science, reflecting the evolving needs of modern society and the energy sector.
