This course introduces the students to the fundamentals of the discipline of Coastal Engineering. It covers a broad range of topics related to the discipline, including how waves are formed, grow, travel across the ocean, shoaling and refraction as they enter shallower coastal waters and eventual wave breaking at the beach.  Waves are the energy that move sediment, and this course covers fundamental sediment transports due to waves and currents as well as the impact of coastal storms on the beaches.  Engineering design considerations including beach nourishment and the design of standard coastal structures are also included topics of this course. The course is structured using a combination of lectures and field teaching along with theory and design practice assessments.
