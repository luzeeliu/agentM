This course provides integrated knowledge of geological processes and seismic geophysical methods essential for energy resource exploration and subsurface engineering applications, including hydrocarbon systems, geothermal energy, and CO2 geostorage.
The first section establishes geological foundations covering sedimentary layering, structural geology, and tectonic processes. Students learn how folding, faulting, and fracturing create subsurface architectures relevant to energy applications. Topics include basin formation, depositional environments, and deformation processes that control reservoir connectivity and seal integrity. This framework enables construction of conceptual geological models for diverse energy resource systems.
The second section introduces seismic geophysics for quantifying and refining these geological models, covering key topics of seismic imaging principles and interpretation techniques for mapping geological structures and reservoir properties. Students learn seismic wave propagation through layered media, acoustic impedance contrasts, and Snell's law applications. The course covers rock physics relationships linking seismic velocities to lithology, porosity, and fluid properties, providing quantitative methods to characterize subsurface formations.
Students develop practical skills to integrate geological models with seismic data, supporting site selection and subsurface engineering decisions across energy resource applications. This foundation prepares students for advanced formation evaluation and reservoir characterization techniques in subsequent courses.
The course is part of the Bachelor of Science major in Earth Science as well as the Bachelor of Engineering. The course fits into the former program because it details how we can image Earth structures and build models of the Earth. For the latter, the course helps in mapping the subsurface and understand the subsurface reservoirs and how they evolve through time.
