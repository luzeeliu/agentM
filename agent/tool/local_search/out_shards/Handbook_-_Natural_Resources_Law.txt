Natural resources law (NRL) is concerned with the government’s authority to make decisions relating to the planning and management of the use of natural resources. The legal system should support effective natural resources management; however, this raises distinct policy problems and requires a diverse range of implementation approaches. The policy issues cross boundaries both horizontally (between government departments) and vertically (between levels of government), posing significant challenges for a federal system.
The course will explore a number of cross-cutting themes such as ecologically sustainable development and integrated planning and management that influence current debate in relation to NRL and will cover the following topics:
Main Topics
Introduction to issues and concepts in natural resources law
Natural resources law at the national level
State land use planning law and intersections with natural resources law
Environmental impact assessment
Water law
Managing soils and land use conflict
Native vegetation law and forestry management
