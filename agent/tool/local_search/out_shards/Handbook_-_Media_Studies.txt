This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Choosing to pursue a minor in Media Studies will equip you with a range of critical skills and knowledge you need to understand, analyse, and respond to the pivotal role of media in contemporary life.
We take as our starting point the proposition that media are much more than news organisations or social platforms: media are fundamental to life, culture, politics, and history.
You will develop critical thinking and writing skills that allow you to make persuasive arguments, engage with challenging issues, and solve new problems. With an array of research methods and analytical techniques in your toolkit, you’ll be able to bring to bear a combination of critical and creative skills and knowledges.
