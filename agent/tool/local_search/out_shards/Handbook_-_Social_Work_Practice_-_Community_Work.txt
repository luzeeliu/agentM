This course introduces you to community work concepts and practice in national and international social work contexts. Drawing on human rights and strengths based approaches you will analyse the changing political contexts in which community work is located. It aims to develop knowledge of the theories and skills you will need to engage in effective community development practice. Applied field examples will be used to assist you to understand and examine the difference between working at the grass roots level, national and international levels, with diverse groups of people. Using case studies from a range of contexts such as social housing, First Nations, refugee, displacement and disasters, you will explore the history and politics of community development. Critical and creative skills in the 'doing' of community development work will be developed. These include skills in community engagement, consultation and needs assessment, working with at risk and marginalised populations, analysing the impacts of age, gender and diversity and in advocacy.
