This course involves an advanced study of contemporary issues in international law, providing an opportunity for deeper exploration beyond fundamental legal principles through the medium of current global challenges. It focusses on key international legal issues and challenges in a thematic examination of significant and often controversial topics. By moving beyond principles-based approaches, the course equips students with the capacity to consider policy dimensions, future directions of international law, and possibilities for systemic change.
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of how international law responds to, shapes, and is shaped by complex global phenomena. Through critical analysis of selected case studies and evolving legal frameworks, students will develop insights into both urgent challenges and long-standing concerns within the international legal system.
It is strongly recommended that students complete a course in principles of international law prior to attempting this course, as it will assume familiarity with the sources and institutions of the international legal system.
