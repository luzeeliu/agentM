to teach a number of issues that influence global finance and the way multinational companies build their global business networks, their activities and strategies. The course also brings a fresh perspective from eminent scholars from various leading business schools in the United States, Europe and Asia, including Nobel Laureate Robert Engle from NYU and others.
Some of the anlaysis and data offered in this course are part of the collaboration between the Institute of Global Finance at the UNSW Business School and the Volatility Institute at Stern Business School, NYU. The latest issues on global finance will be taught in this course, with presentations, videos and online financial data. The basic thrust of this course is to provide a framework within which the key global financial issues, including the operations of multinational companies, can be analysed. This course is designed to develop students understanding of the business and financial aspects of their main specialisation. The course prepares students for leadership roles and builds understanding of global financial forces that could influence the overall business environment. We also invite guest lecturers from industry, including experts from KPMG, to share their insights with students.
