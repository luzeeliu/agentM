What are you curious about? How can you use your imagination to address the urgent questions we face collectively as humans? In this course we aim to understand the relationship between literary craft, power and society as we work on grappling with ideas, telling true stories and telling them well. You will explore the forms and practices of nonfiction, from the playful and radical form of the personal essay to literary journalism and narrative nonfiction. You will have the opportunity to take the thoughts and questions that spark your curiosity and wrestle with them on the page, connecting them to global challenges by using language in a fresh and engaging way. Critical analysis of the best Australian and international nonfiction will complement the practical development of your own creative work in a supportive workshop environment. You will acquire an appreciation of the ethical and theoretical issues underpinning the writing of nonfiction, develop your craft as a writer, enhance your Career Development Learning, and understand more about the relationship between yourself and our world.
