Systematics investigates historical aspects of evolution and establishes evidence-based classifications and genealogical relationships between organisms. Phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics, provides a basis for hierarchical classification and a framework for examining other evolutionary and biological events. These include historical biogeography, sexual coevolution, host-parasite coevolution, as well as applied research in conservation biology and biodiversity. This course is designed to introduce the principles and application of phylogenetic systematic using a variety of organisms. The laboratories will place emphasis on the use of computer software and examples from major clades of the Tree of Life.
Students should note that a compulsory five-day field trip will occur in the flexibility week (typically week 6).
