Data from the Hubble Space Telescope has been used to produce stunning images of other galaxies, highlighting their dramatic diversity. From massive spiral galaxies like the Milky Way to compact elliptical galaxies where star formation has long since ceased, observations of galaxies provide clues about the origins of the Universe and how it has evolved over the past 14 billion years.
In this course, students will understand the structure and kinematics of the most well-studied galaxy, the Milky Way, and how it has developed over time, informed by a comparison to other galaxies over cosmic time. Students will also learn how modern astronomical surveys have transformed our understanding of the Universe and our Galaxy’s place in it. Topics to be covered include: structure and kinematics of the Milky Way, fundamental properties of galaxies, galactic chemical evolution, expansion of the Universe, star formation history and formation of galaxies, effects of galaxy mergers, epoch of reionisation, evidence for dark matter and dark energy, and cosmological models.
The course is intended primarily for Level 3 undergraduates taking a Physics major, for which this course is an elective, and consists of both lectures and tutorials.
