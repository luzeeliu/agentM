This thematic course will explore developments in competition law in established (likely to be Japan and Korea) and new (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) jurisdictions using Australian, US and EU law as background. Reference will also be made to the laws of the ASEAN jurisdictions. The focus areas will be competition policy, the economic and political background to each jurisdiction, and the major established competition law areas: arrangements between competitors and others; abuse of dominance and the like; mergers and acquisitions; and enforcement and remedies. The course will consider the issues of exemptions and application to the activities of governments and their businesses; issues of economic nationalism and the "national interest" and other topical issues. It will also deal with moves to uniformity of competition laws internationally.
