This course offers a systematic and critical examination of the environmental challenges confronting society today, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, waste management, and water resource issues. It aims to equip students from any discipline with a robust level of environmental awareness, necessary for responsible participation in critical environmental debates.
You will explore a theoretical framework that articulates the nature of environmental issues and the policy options available for addressing them. The course comprehensively addresses human impacts on the natural world, the key drivers of environmental degradation—including economic growth, technology, and population dynamics—and the resulting consequences.
A significant focus will be placed on fiscal policy and tax incentives as effective tools for promoting environmental sustainability. By integrating contemporary legal, economic, taxation, and environmental developments, the course underscores the practical relevance of these topics. Special emphasis is given to environmental-related taxation policies, examining how these fiscal strategies are crucial for safeguarding the environment.
