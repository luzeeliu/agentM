From theory to prototype, how does it happen? Have you ever wondered how Mechanical Design Engineers come up with innovative solutions to make the world a better place?
In your degree, you have learned many theoretical designs and concepts. In this course, you will learn how to apply your knowledge and how to think critically to transform the theory into working prototypes. Most importantly, you will learn how to tackle open-ended problems and take ownership of your learning. These skills are essential in your future life as engineer.
The course has been designed to replicate all the phases of a mechanical design project in industry from design to manufacturing and prototype testing. A project-based learning approach has been implemented with a hands-on experience. You will build your prototype in the workshop and test it!
In this course, you will undertake a major design project as a team, enabling them to develop conceptual and detailed solutions for an engineering project, utilizing and extending their knowledge and skills acquired throughout the degree program. This includes project-based design process, project management, design for manufacturing, reliability, affordability, and sustainability.
Finally, you will get the opportunity to work within a team and strengthen your technical communication skills from the design phase using CAD tools to the testing phase with the support of academics and technical staff. Industrial partners will be invited to give you an insight into their professional experiences.
