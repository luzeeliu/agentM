This studio elective introduces you to the foundations of rigging for animation. The course is designed to build on your existing knowledge of 3D CGI principles and techniques so that you can enhance your practice in this area. Throughout the course, you will expand your understanding of this specialised field of practice by creating rigging systems that drive and control the movement of 3D objects. The course draws on a wide range of sources, including virtual sculpting processes, anatomy, physiology, colour theory, and visual storytelling. In a supportive studio environment, you will be encouraged to experiment with new approaches and concepts, as well as integrate workflow techniques that can be applied in other contexts.
