Telecommunications engineering is the most rapidly developing and dynamic field of Engineering. The School's undergraduate BE (Hons) program in Telecommunications continue to act as a model for educating engineers in tomorrow's technology. Options within Telecommunications include: Photonics, Systems and Control, Energy Systems, Microelectronics and Signal Processing.
The undergraduate curricula are being progressively revised to provide flexible training to suit the future needs of students. Individual student needs can be further met by substitution provisions within the programs.
The Telecommunications specialisation consists of 168 UOC as described below. The specialisation structure outlined below gives one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the degree. The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise the student's choice of courses. While some courses are taught twice a year, many courses are taught only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Students are strongly encouraged to consult the Electrical Engineering School website for the recommended program structure and for advice on course selection sequences that are consistent with timetabling and availability.
