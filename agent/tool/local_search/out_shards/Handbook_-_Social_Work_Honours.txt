This program is for students commencing from 2019.
Students commencing prior to 2019 should refer to the program rules for the year in which they started.
The
Bachelor of Social Work with Honours (UNSW BSW Hons)
offers you an innovative and accredited program leading to qualification as a professional social worker with eligibility for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). The UNSW BSW (Hons) includes studies in the areas of social work practice, social and behavioural sciences, and fields of practice which include, work with Aboriginal people, counselling skills, community and group work, ethical practice, working with mental health and trauma and child protection. The program includes a number of courses aimed at the development of research skills, including research design and methodology, and every student completes a piece of independent or directed research or a professional practice portfolio as part of the Honours requirement.
The UNSW BSW (Hons) draws on the extensive expertise and experience of qualified Social Work practitioners to deliver a unique combination of scholarly and practice-based courses. Students also undertake two separate field placements in Years 3 and 4 of the degree to gain the necessary practical experience.
Level 4 of the program requires a research-based thesis or enquiry-based professional portfolio, undertaken through a capstone that integrates scholarship with professional work contexts. The Honours Thesis SOCW4015 has a WAM cut-off of 70 for entry. The Advanced Practice Honours Portfolio (SOCW4016) does not have a WAM cut-off. Upon successful completion of all program requirements, all students will graduate with Honours (AQF Level 8).

Compulsory Training Component
An integral aspect of the program core is organised learning in the field and this is a basic requirement for the professional recognition of the degree. In the field education courses, a field educator, usually in a social welfare agency, is responsible for a student learning to apply the principles of professional practice in an actual practice setting. From Level 3, a total of 140 seven-hour days are taken up in this way. Forty of these days are scheduled during academic recess periods. A student's two field education placements take place  in more different types of practice setting. The settings vary and can include medical, psychiatric, local government, community health, community, family and child welfare, services to groups with disabilities, services to the aged, services to migrants, income security, and corrective services. Non-government social welfare agencies and all levels of government are utilised. For some students opportunities exist to undertake the second field education placement in rural areas or in select international locations. SOCW3012 and SOCW3013 and SOCW4017 and SOCW4018 are the designated field education courses.
Progression Requirements
Exit Strategies
Students unable to meet the requirements of either Social Work Practice - Level 3 and/or Level 4 placement may, with approval, repeat the course a maximum of one time.
Students unable to meet the requirements of Social Work Practice - Level 4 Placement, or who have completed the requisite UOC courses levels 1-3 inclusive, may exit the program and enrol in the Bachelor of Welfare Studies. It should be noted that this program does not provide eligibility for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers. Students undertaking double degree programs who wish to exit the BSW (Hons) program are not permitted to enrol in the Bachelor of Welfare Studies alongside any other program of study. Double degree students who withdraw from Social Work can complete their associated dual degree in single mode or apply for credit transfer to another UNSW degree program.

Recognition of Achievement
Expand all
University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
Honours classes will be awarded based on the student’s WAM, which will be calculated to two decimal places and will not be rounded up or down. Students must achieve the minimum cut-off in the following classes in order to be eligible:
Honours Class I (selective WAM of 85 or higher)
Honours Class II division 1, (selective WAM of 75-84)
Honours Class II division 2 (selective WAM of 65-74)
Honours Class III (selective WAM of 50-64)
The award will be calculated on the basis of the WAM for Level 3 and 4 Program Core courses in Social Work, with the selected Honours course (SOCW4015 or SOCW4016) weighted as 24 UOC to recognise integration of learning with professional practice in SOCW4017 (6UOC) and SOCW4018 (12UOC).
The WAM of Level 3 and 4 core courses in the Social Work (Honours) program are applied towards the award of the Honours Class. Therefore students cannot receive Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) or undertake these courses in the Exchange Program as such courses completed are recorded as credit transfer without marks and cannot be included in the WAM calculation.
Additional Information
PARTICIPATION AND ENROLMENT REQUIREMENTS
It is a requirement that students who are undertaking placements in certain government departments and related organisations undergo criminal record checks as follows:
Working with Children Check
The Working With Children Check (WWCC) is valid for five years. It is a requirement for all students and is specifically designed for people who work or volunteer in child-related work. It involves a national criminal history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct. The result of a WWCC is either a clearance to work with children for five years, or a bar against working with children. Cleared applicants are subject to ongoing monitoring and relevant new records may lead to the clearance being revoked. The WWCC is fully portable so it can be used for any paid or unpaid child-related work in NSW for as long as the worker remains cleared.
Students can apply for a WWCC number on the NSW Office of the Children's Guardian website. To be eligible for a WWCC you will have to show proof of identity to a NSW Motor Registry or Council Agency. For more information you may access the online tutorials and fact sheets at
Working with Children Check
.
National Criminal Record Check
A National Criminal Record Check is valid for three years. You must undergo a National Criminal Record Check and provide an original copy of the Check results to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. The result of a Working With Children Check is either that there are 'no disclosable outcomes', or that there are 'disclosable outcomes' which are then detailed in the certificate. If you have a disclosable outcome(s) on your criminal record check you will need to undergo a risk assessment. Please contact the Work Integrated Learning Unit for further information about this.
All placement students are subject to ongoing monitoring and must disclose new ‘disclosable outcomes’ to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. Some agencies (e.g NSW Health) only accept National Criminal Record Checks obtained through specific accredited agencies.
Compliance with NSW Health Vaccination Requirements (NSW Health funded placements).
Vaccinations
In order to undertake placement in a NSW Health funded facility, you need to demonstrate evidence of protection against the following diseases:
Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough)
Hepatitis B
Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
Varicella (chickenpox)
Tuberculosis (TB) - As specified on the Vaccination Card, this check is only required if you were born in a country with a high incidence of TB, or you have lived or travelled in a high risk TB country cumulatively for 3 months or more.
Evidence of protection against these diseases must be recorded on the NSW Health vaccination card by a GP and serology reports must be provide for some diseases (reports from your doctor where protection is measured in your blood).
Green P Drivers Licence
Many agencies require that students have a Green P Drivers Licence or above. Although it is not compulsory to have a NSW Drivers License to undertake placement, it is an essential requirement for social work tasks in most agencies. Not having a Green P or unrestricted Driver’s License will significantly limit student placement options.
