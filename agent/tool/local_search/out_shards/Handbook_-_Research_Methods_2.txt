This course provides an introduction to inferential data analysis procedures for experimental and correlational designs. It builds on the principles of research design and descriptive statistics covered in PSYC1111 Measuring Mind and Behaviour, and it prepares students for more advanced inferential statistical procedures covered in PSYC3001 Research Methods 3. It is a pre-requisite for all third-year courses in Psychology. Topics include sampling distributions, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for between-group and repeated measures designs, power, correlation, prediction, and factorial designs. Students will learn to design, analyse and interpret experiments, enabling them to draw justified conclusions and communicate them clearly. Theory and procedures taught in lectures and online lessons will be reinforced through hands-on experience in tutorials and computing labs.
