Foundations Enrichment 2 is aligned with the aims and outcomes of the core course: Torts. The course provides a culturally effective means of support for Indigenous students transitioning into legal study. Classes provide an opportunity to clarify and extend work covered in Torts.
In this course students also observe the law in practice via the legal aid system, including the Kingsford Legal Centre (KLC), and various other experiences. Students will use these experiences to discuss the specific ways in which it impacts on clients from diverse backgrounds.
The course is delivered in small group tutorial groups that focus on case reading, statutory interpretation and legal problem-solving and writing skills. It also seeks to develop critical and analytical skills particularly in relation to the role of Tort law.
