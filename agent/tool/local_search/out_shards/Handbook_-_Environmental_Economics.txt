The environment is one of the most important and most debated modern policy issues. This course provides an economic perspective on this debate. We will discuss the reasons behind why environmental problems exist, why unregulated markets sometimes fail in this context, and potential economic solutions to these problems, which include regulations, taxes, subsidies, and pollution permit trading schemes. We will also cover methods for determining the benefits and costs of environmental preservation. The course will equip you with the necessary knowledge to take part in the discussion about environmental policy from an economic perspective.
