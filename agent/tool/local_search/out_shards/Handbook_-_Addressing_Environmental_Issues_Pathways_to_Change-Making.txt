In this course, you will look at how you can apply the frameworks and insights you have gained in your postgraduate environment and society studies to the environmental issues you care about most. Before enrolling, you ideally should complete IEST5006 (Rethinking Environment) and the majority of your coursework as this course provides most benefit at/near the end of your program. The course uses an interdisciplinary approach in which you are encouraged to attend to the complexity of environmental issues and to develop effective proposals for action. While the course touches on a wide range of frameworks introduced throughout your preceding courses, you will develop several in greater depth in response to your interests and future career and research plans. You will learn about the nature of and need for multi- or trans-disciplinary approaches for addressing environment and society problems of local, national, and/or global importance. You will be supported to explore case studies and approaches that you intend to engage in your change-making and leadership work after you finish your coursework.
