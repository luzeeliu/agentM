This course builds on the concepts of protein structure and function that were introduced in the two pre-requisite courses, BIOC2101 and BIOC2201, to provide a comprehensive introduction to modern protein science. The lecture series covers fundamental aspects of protein structure and function, with an emphasis on the latest analytical tools and processes employed in protein characterisation. Other topics covered include protein-protein interactions, protein folding, and protein engineering, with a strong focus on proteomics, which is the large-scale study of proteins inside the cell. BIOC3111 is core to the Molecular and Cell Biology Major and a highly valuable elective in other related discipline areas such as biotechnology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry. BIOC3111 is designed to provide an authentic experience in the inquiry process underlying scientific research and discovery. In particular, the practical component is an extended 8-week project that engages students with the process of experimental design and provides extensive hands-on laboratory experience. The course also integrates focused training in scientific writing that is supported by thorough feedback on scientific report assignments.
