Description
Corporate Responsibility and Accountability examines how business manages its social, environmental and economic impact on society.
The course first reviews the historical evolution and development of the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Citizenship and why it is now a key part of managing the business enterprise.
Second, the course examines what acting responsibly means for corporations in terms of the market, community, environment, workplace and government. Issues covered include business and human rights, business-community partnerships, corporate philanthropy, the human resource management implications of CSR, business and the environment and businesses’ relationship with government.
Third, the course examines how business accounts for its behaviour and impact in society through sustainability reporting and the role of external assurance and outlines debates on the appropriate role of government policy in either regulating and/or enabling responsible corporate behaviour.
This course is an Elective in the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact program (7357) and the Business Administration (Specialised) – 8625: Social Impact - MNGTKS8625 Stream.
