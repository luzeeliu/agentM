Description
Professional organizational communication is underpinned by the ability to form positive relationships and navigate differences in the workplace. While we often assume that business communication is a rational process, workplaces are also impacted on by emotions that employees carry with them. While issues of language, culture and emotion underpin all interpersonal communication, students in this course are particularly encouraged to apply theories, concepts and ideas of interpersonal communication to issues, challenges, and opportunities in corporate and other organizational contexts. The course will focus on application of interpersonal communication concepts and processes to organizational contexts, opportunities, challenges and issues. Key topics in this course include organizational communication and discourse, negotiation, persuasion, lobbying, advocacy, managing change, valuing diversity, ethical decision-making and conflict resolution.
