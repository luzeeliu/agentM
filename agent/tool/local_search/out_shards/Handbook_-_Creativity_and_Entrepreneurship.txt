This course provides an understanding of the various definitions of entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity and how they intersect, influence and are shaped by designers. Creativity tools and different models of thinking are examined from a theoretical and real world perspective, to provide you with knowledge and practical techniques to help develop your careers.
Entrepreneurship takes many forms in different organisations and industries, and this course demonstrates the interconnectedness between new creative ideas, innovations, design thinking methods, and the various components needed to become an entrepreneur. Personal traits, different working environments, and various creative processes combine to enhance innovative idea development, and this is critically explored in the course content. Through lectures, tutorials, case studies and active learning in assessed coursework, you will engage with examples of entrepreneurial innovation, and develop your own creative capacity.
