There’s been something of a renaissance in Blak pop culture in recent decades. From children's TV shows to literary fiction, through film and music in every genre, sports broadcasting, memes and viral protest movements, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander creatives have made the most of changing media environments to find and reach new audiences. In this course, we’ll engage with a range of Blak pop culture. We’ll listen to music and watch cartoons. Along the way, you’ll learn to critically interpret and analyse popular culture and constructively engage in debates involving the politics of representation. You’ll learn about the entanglement of popular culture and power. We’ll focus especially on how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander creatives have leveraged this complex to advance Indigenous interests.
