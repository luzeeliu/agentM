The aviation industry is a highly regulated and legislated sector. In alignment with this, an aviation professional should be conversant with, and knowledgeable of, the law as it applies to the aviation industry. However, although aviation professionals are highly trained technicians or managers, their training does not necessarily include significant knowledge and skills development in the law and legal systems. In fact, most sections of the aviation industry there are no formal requirements for training in the law or legal systems. Of course, there is a myriad of rules and regulations in aviation that must be known but that does not equate to training in statutory interpretation or the like.
Aviation Law and Regulations
focuses on providing a comprehensive overview of the regulatory structure of civil aviation in Australia and also an understanding of this structure within a legal context. Topics include the Australian legal system, contract law; employment law and administrative law; criminal law and commercial law; and airline operations. The course provides students with the opportunity to start developing the skills needed to become an aviation professional knowledgeable in both aviation and the law through case-based learning delivered by industry experts and assessments exploring current aviation and legal issues. Development of these skills, knowledge and confidence will empower students to make appropriate decisions for addressing aviation challenges in their careers, whilst accommodating the changing needs of society with consideration of aviation regulations and the law.
