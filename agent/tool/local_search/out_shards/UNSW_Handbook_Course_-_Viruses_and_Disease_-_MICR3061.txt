Description
The course explores the biology of viruses and their unique strategic properties that enable their persistance. We will examine virus structure, classification and replication strategies, epidemiology, molecular virology, laboratory diagnosis, and applications of viruses in biotechnology, including gene therapy. The pathogenesis of a number of human, animal and plant diseases is discussed in the context of virus-host interactions, as well as the persistance, transfer and control of virus infections in the community. A WebCT component of the course allows students to engage in on-line computer activities including virtual experiments, electron micrograph identification, group discussions and research for the final consultancy brief project.The final "consultancy brief" project provides students with an opportunity to gain experience in working in consultancy teams, utilise the WebCT platform for discussions to facilitate research on a current topic in virology for a "client", and produce a professional report and a short seminar.
