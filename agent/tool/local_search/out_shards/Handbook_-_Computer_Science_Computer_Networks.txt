Networks are critical infrastructure in modern society, and look set to grow in importance in the future. Business, finance, health services, education, defence and leisure all rely on the existence of a stable, secure, fast, high-capacity network. Computing professionals with a deep understanding of networks will be in high demand for the foreseeable future both to maintain and enhance existing network infrastructure (especially mobile networks), and to develop new forms of networking.
The Computer Networks stream in the Computer Science program exposes students to the foundations of computer networks, their architecture, their management and emerging application areas, such as the Internet of Things.
