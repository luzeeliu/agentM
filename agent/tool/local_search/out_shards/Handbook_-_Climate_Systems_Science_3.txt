This course provides a thorough overview of the climate system and its scientific study. In lectures and hands-on lab sessions, the different components of the climate system – including the atmosphere, ocean, biosphere, and cryosphere – are introduced, and their complex interactions are discussed. These interactions include feedbacks between the Earth's carbon cycle, hydrological cycle, biosphere and key chemical species. The course covers the scientific study of the climate system, including observational approaches and uncertainties; statistical methods used to detect and understand environmental changes; and modelling techniques including idealised models, process models and comprehensive state-of-the-art climate and Earth system models. Students receive hands-on experience in running and interpreting results from a climate model to interrogate changes and interactions in the climate system.
