The possibility of intelligent machines has long been a favourite subject of speculation for philosophers, computer scientists, and science-fiction writers. But things are different today: technology has advanced to the point where the fascinating and troubling questions raised by Artificial Intelligence must be addressed head-on. Some of those we consider in this course are foundational questions in the philosophy of mind. What is intelligence, and can machines really possess it? Could it be that—as many have argued—we ourselves are no more than intelligent machines (designed by evolution rather than engineers)? How do technologies such as artificial neural networks and machine learning change our understanding of the mind? Others are ethical, social, and political. What are the risks associated with these technologies, and how can we minimise them? What are their benefits, and how can we ensure that they are equitably shared? Conversely, assuming that true A.I. is possible, what are our own moral obligations towards our non-human but intelligent creations?
No background in computer science is required for this course.
