The Bachelor of Environmental Management program contains a core sequence of compulsory courses, a choice of disciplinary Majors and choices from a group of Directed Electives. The Majors include Biology, Earth Science, Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Geography and Marine and Coastal Science.
The aim of the program is to provide a strong education in the skills and knowledge necessary to work or carry out research as an environmental scientist. In addition to the graduate attributes applicable to
3970 Bachelor of Science
, graduates of the B. Env. Mgmt. will need to be able to place their understanding of the scientific aspects of the environment within the general context of the policy and legal framework of environmental regulations, as well as economic and social dimensions to environmental policy and management. The B. Env. Mgmt. is designed as a 3 year (full-time) program. There is also an opportunity for students to continue onto an Honours year in Program 4500 Science (Honours), if they satisfy the entry requirements (usually a Credit WAM) or to combine the B. Env. Mgmt. with the
Masters of Environmental Management
(Program 8623).

Program Structure
Students must complete 144 UOC when taken as a standalone program.
Students in the Environmental Management program are expected to complete the following requirements:
120 UOC Environmental Management courses
:
- 60 UOC of core Environmental Management courses.
- One approved major
- Prescribed electives
A course can only count once as 6 UOC towards the 144 UOC: if a course is in both the compulsory course list and within an approved Major, then additional Prescribed Electives must be taken so that the compulsory courses, approved Major and Prescribed Electives totals 120 UOC.
12 UOC Free Electives
. These courses can be taken from any Faculty of the University at any stage of your program.
12 UOC General Education courses
. These courses cannot be Science courses. These courses can be taken from any Faculty of the University at any stage of your program.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.
Special Admission Requirements
Expand all
Other
keyboard_arrow_down
Some Schools within the Faculty may grant students exemption from completing particular first year courses. Where an exemption is given this is not added to a student's academic record and hence does not reduce the total units of credit the student must complete for the program. The exemption merely grants a student the ability to undertake higher level courses (such as second year courses) that require the exempted course as a prerequisite. Students with an exemption will need to be manually enrolled in higher level courses by administrative staff.

University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Award of Pass with Distinction
keyboard_arrow_down
The Award of Pass with Distinction is awarded when a weighted average mark (WAM) of at least 75% has been achieved and at least 50% of the requirements of the award completed at UNSW.
All eligible programs will award Pass with Distinction except in special circumstances where approval of Academic Board has been given for a program to opt out.

Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
Faculty General Rules and Requirements
page.
Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing section below for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Program Fees
At UNSW fees are generally charged at course level and therefore dependent upon individual enrolment and other factors such as student's residency status. For generic information on fees and additional expenses of UNSW programs, click on one of the following:
