Australia has a high diversity of globally unique vertebrate species (e.g., platypus, possums, frogs, parrots, snakes etc.). This course examines the evolution, diversity and natural history of these animals with a special emphasis on how their bodies work and how they cope with Australia’s challenging environments. It covers the evolutionary origins and relationships between the major vertebrate groups and explores their diversity of form, function and behavior. There is a detailed investigation of birds and mammals, particularly their origins, life history and emerging conservation issues.
