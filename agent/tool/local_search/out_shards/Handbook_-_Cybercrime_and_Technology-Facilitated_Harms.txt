In this course you will examine how the online world has borne new crimes and facilitated the commission of existing crimes. As well as exploring definitions and categories of cybercrime, you will be invited to consider technology-facilitated harm and violence, engaging with cutting edge criminological scholarship that recgonises the integration of online and offline worlds when it comes to crime, justice and victimisation. In doing so, you will examine contemporary and emerging challenges that digital and communications technologies have presented for criminologists, policymakers, and law enforcement officials in attempting to understand and respond to crime in a digital society. Topic explored may include fraud, hacking, and cyberbullying, as well as emergent issues such as image-based abuse, technology-facilitated domestic and family violence, digilantism, and cyberterrorism. In examining these topics you will consider the socio-cultural, socio-political, and social inequalities that are at play.
