Design resolution, at a fine scale, highlights issues of quality and plays a central role in detailing to achieve buildings and interiors which are original and coherent examples of good design. This course aims to enhance your critical capacity when assessing design options by extending your design vocabulary, and your ability to design at a range of scales, from the broad to the specific. The course also introduces strategies for developing detail at various stages of the design process.
This elective course offers a special focus on detailing and documentation often not realised in Design Studio. It is particularly suited to Interior Architects and Architecture disciplines, as well as other students who have a practical understanding of drafting software and the language of documentation (technical drawing skills including plans, sections and elevations).
The program is fast paced and requires the production of a consistent documentation package. which in turn requires research, identification and resolution of design construction issues. Because all course work involves a mix of group and individual work, you need to be able to establish a process and commitment for group work.
