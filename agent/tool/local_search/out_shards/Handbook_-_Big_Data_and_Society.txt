What is big data and how is it being used? How are governments gathering, combining, manipulating and applying huge data sets to inform policy making? What is the role of big data in machine learning, predictive analytics and other automated processes that are reshaping the private sector? What kinds of new research methods are needed to extract meaningful insights from massive, complex data sets? This course will help you to understand the social and political context surrounding contemporary hype around big data and its proclaimed social and economic benefits. You will explore the evolution of data—from simple digital information to massive datasets, and more recently, to a driver of artificial intelligence—recognising how big data is not just a tool, but a powerful discourse and zeitgeist of our time. You will use a critical lens to examine the underlying assumptions that structure big data, the human labour and social relations that sustain these supposedly automated processes, and the application of big data by governments and companies. You will develop an understanding of new and emerging research methods that extend social science inquiry to the age of big data.
