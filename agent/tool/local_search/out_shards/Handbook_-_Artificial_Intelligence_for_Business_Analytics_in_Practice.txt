Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) have transformed how businesses and organisations operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Although AI provides organisations with opportunities to convert data into actionable insights to address business problems and make better and more efficient data-driven decisions, there is still a talent gap regarding this critical skillset. In response to the growing need for AI-related skills in organisations, INFS5705 course is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge and competencies in AI-driven analytics.
This course adopts an active learning and Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, and places students' learning experience at the forefront. Through extensive hands-on experience using state-of-the-art AI techniques (e.g., natural language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms) to analyse structured and unstructured data in business contexts, this course engages students in extensive hands-on exercises on AI-driven analytics to address real-world business problems.
Building on the foundational knowledge acquired in NFS5730, or COMM5007, students will consolidate their analytical competencies and critical thinking on how to apply AI and ML techniques using a variety of software such as R, Python, and SAS Viya for automated ML, to conduct analytics applied to real world business problems.
On successful completion of this course, students will gain highly demanded skillsets to tackle challenges and solve complex business problems when they enter the workplace.
