In this course you will critically analyse crime prevention strategies and criminal justice responses to violent crime. You will take account of policy and legislative issues nationally and internationally, and address wider issues of risk assessment, offender treatment and victim support in dealing with violent crime. You will question the relationship between crime prevention, risk assessment strategies and treatment for violent offenders and evaluate support services and criminal justice responses towards victims of crime. To do so you will draw on case studies about serious violent crime including homicide, sexual offences, domestic violence and war crimes, and take a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the diverse needs and challenges in preventing and responding to violence.
