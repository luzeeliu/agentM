This program is not available to International applicants. It is not a full-time program.
The Master of Counselling Social Work (MCSW) is a 2-year part-time, 48 UOC program offered through the School of Social Sciences. This program is provided flexibly in Face-to-Face/Blended mode; with an option to complete each course in the program fully online.
The MCSW is designed for practicing social workers, to consolidate and extend counselling knowledge and skills. The MCSW develops your knowledge and skills in counselling by building on your professional social work experience and providing a contextual and relational orientation to counselling. During the program, you will study a number of counselling approaches and apply these approaches to your own counselling social work practice. You will have the opportunity to engage in in-depth analysis of your own practice in peer and consultant-led case discussion groups. In both theory seminars and practice seminars, a participatory format is used to allow you and your fellow students to integrate ideas with your own counselling orientation and context.
