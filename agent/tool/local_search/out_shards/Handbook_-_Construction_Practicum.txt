This course involves students working on a hands on infrastructure project. Projects will involve infrastructure such as buildings, bridges, water supply and drainage, and historical structures. Within a nominated project, students are expected to develop, design, estimate, plan, construct, and manage the processes.  The emphasis in the course is on the students learning by doing and having a hands-on approach.  Students take theory learned in other courses and apply it in practice.  Students are expected to think for themselves, deal with situations that they have not come across before, and think in a practical and professional way. Each time the course is offered it will be based on a different project so that students will need to solve new problems and address novel issues.
