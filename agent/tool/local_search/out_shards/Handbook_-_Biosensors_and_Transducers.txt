This course serves as an introduction to physiological measurement using biosensors and transducers. This course deals primarily with gaining an understanding of the physical principles which govern the measurement of a biological variable or system, by a transducer which converts the variable into an electrical signal. By the end of the course you should understand various measurement devices and approaches including the underlying biological process that generates the quantity to be measured or controlled. The basic biosensors and transducers used to measure pressure, flow, volume and kinematics are examined along with aspects of electrical safety and imaging instrumentation.
