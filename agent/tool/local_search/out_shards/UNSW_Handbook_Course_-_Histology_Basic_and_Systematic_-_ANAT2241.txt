Description
The first half of this course provides an overview of the structure of mammalian cells and their organisation into tissues.  Topics include the use of virtual microscopy and the  morphological examination of epithelium, glands, connective tissue (e.g. cartilage, bone and blood), muscle, and nervous tissues.  An emphasis will be placed on the recognition of cell types and the correlation of structure and function. The second half of the course deals with a histological examination of the major body systems namely cardiovascular, respiratory, lymphatic, integumentary, digestive, endocrine, urinary, reproductive, and special senses.  Emphasis will be placed on integrating structure of a system with function. This whole course provides an excellent basis for the future study of pathological disorders.
This course may not be taken if you have previously completed ANAT2511.
