In this course students will explore the history, philosophy, theory, and methods of Western science and ethnoscience. Students will critique the development, application, and dissemination of traditional Indigenous knowledge about the natural world, including astronomy, weather, medicine, geography, and mathematics. ATSI2015 Science of Indigenous Knowledge provides a framework for students to explore the history and development of science in both Western and Indigenous contexts by learning how knowledge systems are developed and how this knowledge is passed down to successive generations through oral tradition and material culture. Students learn about the history of colonial "scientific" practices that disempowered Indigenous people and led to environmental damage and unsustainable practices. Students will discover ways in which Indigenous Knowledge can inform and benefit Western science, and investigate how scientists and Indigenous communities are now collaborating to provide new technologies and developing sustainable practices that are beneficial to all. Students will use the tools they learn to benefit their careers and practices to move toward a sustainable and mutually beneficial future.
