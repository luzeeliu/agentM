Description
Modern aspects of the structure function relationships of proteins including discussion of the latest techniques of protein characterisation. Topics include: separation and analytical procedures; determination of amino acid sequence data; the nature of protein and protein ligand interactions including aspects of substrate binding, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanisms; the molecular architecture of proteins from the standpoint of the relationships among primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures; aspects of protein engineering; use of bioinformatics in understanding protein structure and function. Practical work illustrates and complements the lectures and provides experience with modern techniques of protein molecular biology.
