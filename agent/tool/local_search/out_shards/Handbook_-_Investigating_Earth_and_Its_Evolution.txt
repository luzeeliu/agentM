This course provides core knowledge about geology, paleontology and Earth’s systems for those wishing to pursue professional careers as geologists, environmental scientists, or earth scientists. It will be of interest to those who wish to understand more about the nature and origin of the Earth’s systems processes like plate tectonics, the formation of rocks and minerals, the evolution of the atmosphere, and the origin of the hydrosphere. Students will gain knowledge about the evolution of life and what the fossil record tells us about past climates and ecosystems.
The course will provide a basis in advanced measurement techniques using ground-, aircraft-, and satellite-based systems. Students will also learn how to use their understanding of geological processes to investigate and manage environmental issues. A comprehensive understanding of Earth’s processes is critical for the development of sustainable societies, protecting our ecosystems, sourcing materials for modern technologies, and economic growth.
There is no assumed knowledge required for the course. Each week students will engage with pre-recorded lectures and attend a laboratory session. There are two trips to the Australian Museum (https://australian.museum), where students will explore one of the world’s best mineral and rock collections and be taken on a behind-the-scenes visit to see the extensive unique fossil collection.
