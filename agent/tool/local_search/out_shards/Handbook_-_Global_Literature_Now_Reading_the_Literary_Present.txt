What can literature tell us about the contemporary world? How does the literary respond to the contemporary world?
This course will introduce you to the field of contemporary literature in English. We will think about the idea of the present, and of the contemporary as a distinct period in literary study. We will discuss aspects of literary form and genre in novels, graphic novels, short stories, poems and film scripts written since 2000. We will investigate topic areas such as ‘Being Human’, ‘Body/Desire’ and ‘Experiment’.
Informing our investigation of the literary present will be ideas about transnational writing and debates in world literature, the impact of digital media ecologies and ideas about the plastic forms of late capitalism, and the excitement and provocation of literary innovation. This course will provide you with practical critical resources for reading, writing, reviewing and teaching global contemporary novels, poems and plays. It is designed for those of you who love to read contemporary literature or who want to discover more about world literature now.
