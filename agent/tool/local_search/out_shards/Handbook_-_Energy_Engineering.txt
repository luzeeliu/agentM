The generation, conversion, storage, and distribution of energy are key to the functioning of modern society. Your skills as an energy engineer will let you tackle some of the biggest challenges of the 21st century in shifting the economy away from fossil fuels. By combining specialist knowledge of energy engineering with advanced knowledge from another engineering field, you will be able to contribute to the design and delivery of clean, sustainable energy systems. You’ll be ready to join a rapidly growing field looking to develop grid scale energy storage, new methods of energy production, and new processes for essential industrial production. You might work on electrochemical energy storage, hydrogen generation and storage, fuel cells, photovoltaics, solar energy, energy system integration, and decarbonisation of processes, becoming one of the first engineers in the future energy economy.
