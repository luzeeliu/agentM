Biological Science
Description
Biological Science is the study of life and living organisms. It brings together and makes use of many areas of science and encompasses all aspects of plant and animal biology including how they interrelate with each other and interact in and with the environment. The importance of the study of Biological Science cannot be overemphasised in a world where the environments, on which plants and animals depend, are under constant threat.
People with training in the biological sciences work in many areas related to the conservation and understanding of the environment and natural resources. Biologists are employed in industries, companies and government departments involved in areas such as agriculture, animal care, horticulture, land and water conservation, fire management, aquaculture and pollution control. Other roles include policy advisors, journalists, waste managers and environment consultants.
At UNSW, you can choose to specialise in the following areas:
Zoology
: Zoology is the study of animals. You will learn about the structure, physiology, behaviour, ecology, genetics, evolution, and classification of animals.
Botany
: The study of plants. You can study the structure, physiology and ecology of plants, and learn to identify the major groups of plant, particularly those in the Australian flora.
Marine Biology
: The study of Marine Biology includes learning about animals, plants and ecosystems in our oceans and waterways.
Evolutionary Biology
: Evolutionary Biology aims to understand how plants and animals have evolved and how natural selection continues to act upon organisms.
Genetics
: Genes control all functions of organisms. This area includes diverse fields such as molecular genetics, human genetics and conservation biology. (Genetics plan and programs partly controlled by Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences.)
Ecology
: To conserve our natural environment we need to understand Ecology, that is, how animals and plants interact with one another as well as their environment, either on land or in the sea.
Studying Biological Science at UNSW
The study of Biological Science at UNSW is primarily through the
School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences
. Biological Science can be studied at UNSW within the Bachelor of Science, the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours), the Bachelor of Environmental Science and several dual degree programs. Disciplines available for study in Biological Sciences at UNSW include: zoology, oceanography, botany, ecology and environmental science.
