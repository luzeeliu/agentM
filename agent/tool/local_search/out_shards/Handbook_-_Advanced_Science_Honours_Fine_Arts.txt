Collaboration between the arts and sciences has the potential to create new knowledge, ideas and processes beneficial to both fields. Artists, musicians and scientists approach creativity, exploration and research in different but increasingly connected ways and perspectives; when working together they open up new ways of seeing, experiencing and interpreting the world around us.
This double degree program enables students to complete a Major sequence from those available in the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) and complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts, where students can study a wide range of animation and moving image, fine art, music and media art disciplines.
The typical duration of this program is 5 years full-time. For admission to the program, students must satisfy the entry requirements to both the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) (3962) and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (4830) programs.
For questions regarding the requirements for the program, students should consult staff in the the Nucleus Student Hub.
