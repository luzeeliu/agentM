Studio Art Practice 1 is the first in a sequence of six core courses that enables you to develop your independent artistic practice. Through a series of structured studio classes, this course introduces you to the making facilities on campus, and promotes material experimentation as a key mode of creative inquiry. The course focuses particularly on generative and iterative studio processes that enable you to accumulate a portfolio of creative experiments. The weekly topics and activities are designed to encourage you to explore connections between materials, processes, and ideas. Diverse examples are used to guide and support you in starting to develop your understanding of the social and cultural contexts that inform artistic practice. Field trips and group work also encourage you to work in peer-to-peer contexts so as to recognise the multiplicity of potential approaches and avenues for developing an artistic practice.
