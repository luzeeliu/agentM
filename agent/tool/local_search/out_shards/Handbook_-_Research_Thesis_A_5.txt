The thesis provides an opportunity for you to bring together engineering principles learned over the previous years of study, and apply these principles to innovatively solve problems, which may include the development of specific designs and/or the investigation of various research hypotheses. Thesis projects are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for your creativity, and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. Typically, the project you work with will have multiple possible solutions or conclusions and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning. The thesis requires you to formulate problems in engineering terms, manage an engineering project and find solutions by applying engineering methods. You will also develop an ability to work in a research and development environment.
Through the thesis, you will put into practice the knowledge and skills that you've learned in your study up to this point. You do this by investigating a research topic, developing a significant software/hardware system, or some combination of these.
Undergraduate theses consist of a single piece of work spread over three courses: Part A, Part B and Part C.
In Thesis A, you will carry out a literature review of your chosen thesis topic with the aim to identify a research and/or development gap. Based on the identified gap you will plan out the research and/or development work to be carried out in Thesis B and Thesis C.
