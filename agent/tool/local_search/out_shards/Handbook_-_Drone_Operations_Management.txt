The drone industry is evolving rapidly. It is an entrepreneurial frontier that calls for a diverse set of skills, current knowledge, and experience to manage high value enterprise operations. Through interactive lectures and case-based learning, students will develop a holistic, systematic understanding of current and emerging commercial drone operations.

This course is suitable for students across a variety of disciplines who wish to develop drone operations skills and knowledge to support their future career.
