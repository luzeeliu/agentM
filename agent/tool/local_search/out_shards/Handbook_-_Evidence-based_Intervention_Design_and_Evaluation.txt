This course is a fully problem-based learning experience. Students will be required to work in teams and individually acting as management consultants/advisors in order to use insights from data analysis to address one of three types of generic problems: (i) to motivate and design an intervention; (ii) to identify and manage risk relating to those interventions; or (iii) to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions.
