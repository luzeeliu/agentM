This course builds on elementary knowledge of differential equations (taught in MATH1231 at UNSW) to provide further theory and methods for solving ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations with illustrative applications in physics, engineering, and biology.
The specific topics for ordinary differential equations include: first order, linear second order, variation of parameters, dynamical systems, power series representations and Frobenius method, orthogonal functions and Fourier series, initial and boundary value problems, eigenfunction expansions, Bessel's equation.
For partial differential equations, topics include: classification, method of separation of variables, application of Fourier series, heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation, applications of Bessel functions.
Tutorials are designed to reinforce the techniques taught in lectures for solving differential equations.
