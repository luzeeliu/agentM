Research design, data collection and analysis are imperative for understanding key areas of aviation such as economic trends, ground operation efficiency, sustainability and environmental impact and passenger satisfaction. Where quantitative data can allow us to measure, assess and predict trends such as levels of safety in an aviation environment, qualitative data can give us insights such as first-hand accounts and non-numerical findings such as passenger perception and customer satisfaction. Both quantitative and qualitative data are necessary to gain business intelligence in aviation, and the combination of the two provides a holistic perspective to address challenges in the aviation industry. In this course, students are taught designing research projects for typical real-world  questions, various methods of collecting quantitative and qualitative data and ways to analyse them efficiently and effectively as well as ethical pitfalls and their avoidance.
