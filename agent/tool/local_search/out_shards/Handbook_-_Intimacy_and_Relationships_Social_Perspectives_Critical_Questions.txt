You will engage key debates on intimacy to appreciate the complexity of relationships in their historical and socio-cultural contexts. You will consider challenges to family formation and intimate relationships through questions such as: How are relations of care and caring experienced, and how do socio-demographic contexts mediate such experiences? How are digital intimacies, unequal and parasocial relationships understood in everyday life? And, how are connectedness, belonging and loneliness – along with vulnerability, disadvantage and difference - felt by families and communities? Through a series of critical case studies, you will examine how diverse forms of intimacy and relationships are felt and understood through the life course. In doing so you will draw on a range of approaches to researching themes such as the relational and the affective, social and individual, self and other, and technologies and power. This course will apply theory to practice relevant social issues, and provide opportunities for research training and project management in the social sciences.
