This course bridges the critical disciplines of geology, geophysics, and mining engineering, providing an in-depth exploration of essential techniques for mining operations. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of fundamental geological principles, such as basic geologic concepts, minerals, rocks, tectonics, geological structures, and the tectonic stress field. The course examines geophysical investigations, covering stereographic projection, drilling and sampling methods, and quantitative analysis of geophysical logs.
Students will investigate mineral exploration, learning about strategies, tools, and geophysical surveys. Airborne geophysics is also a key focus, with discussions on general considerations and survey specifications. Additionally, the course covers ore deposits and coal geology, examining processes and classifications. Mine hydrogeology is addressed, focusing on water management and groundwater monitoring. Through practical examples and case studies, students will develop the skills necessary to effectively interpret and apply geological and geophysical data in mining operations.
