Description
“Physical Chemistry: Materials, Structure and Function” builds on the thermodynamics and quantum chemistry in CHEM2011, adding the use of symmetry, computational chemistry and X-ray and neutron scattering, all of which are core to contemporary chemistry research. The application of physical techniques is illustrated by their use in studying the surfaces of solids and liquids, an area dominated by unique phenomena at the nanoscale and an area of intense interdisciplinary research interest.
