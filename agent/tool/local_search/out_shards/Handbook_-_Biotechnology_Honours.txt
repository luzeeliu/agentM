Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services. In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.
The development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.
Microorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.
The future for expansion in all the above areas is immense. Our ability to cope with many medical, environmental, agricultural and manufacturing problems in the 21st century will depend heavily on advances in biotechnology.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.

Progression Requirements
Progression to Stage 4 (the honours year) of this program is subject to academic performance.
Where students successfully complete a total of 144 UoC and all the requirements of the first three stages of the program, including Level I/II/III, major, and general education requirements, with a weighted average mark of 65%, they can apply for entry into the Stage 4 honours component. Further details about the honours year can be found here
https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/study-us/undergraduate/honours-degrees/honours-how-apply
If a student is not permitted to progress in Biotechnology (Honours) they will be required to transfer to, and graduate from, program 3970 Bachelor of Science with a Biotechnology major.
Students enrolled in the Biotechnology (Honours) program who wish to take out the Bachelor of Science award at pass level without proceeding to Honours must apply to early exit / graduate during the final term prior to honours.

Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing section below for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
Faculty General Rules and Requirements
page.
