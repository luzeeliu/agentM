This course will give you the tools and techniques to communicate your designs, ideas and concepts. You are introduced to methods of communicating from conceptual design through to design resolution. The course exposes you to a wide range of styles and mediums for communication ranging from the technical to the experimental. Through a series of projects you are encouraged to explore this range of communication styles and to embed your own personal style within the work.
This course teaches both analogue and digital skills, encouraging you to oscillate between them to explore different ways of designing and communicating. Upon completion, you will have been exposed to drawing, modelling and presentation skills that form the foundation of how you will communicate your ideas, process and designs throughout your degree and into practice.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
