This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Specialising in Communication & Journalism as part of your Bachelor of Media at UNSW will provide you with the knowledge, skills, and experience you need to make your mark in journalism and related communication fields.
Combining core capabilities in the fundamentals of journalism with electives that allow you to tailor your expertise, you will learn practical skills and critical perspectives on the fast-changing world of digital journalism, public communication, and news media. Learning how to tell stories effectively, ethically, and powerfully will be at the heart of your studies, ranging from the page to the screen to virtual reality environments. And strong multi-platform storytelling is just the start. You’ll be encouraged to become an influential, entrepreneurial, and strategic communicator able to take a leadership role, tackle complex issues, and take part in a global industry. Ethics and justice are inseparable from how we teach, so you will leave UNSW with a strong understanding of how diversity, difference, and power play out in journalism and other media industries.
After graduating, you'll have the skills, knowledge, and professional experience you need to craft a career in journalism and communication, and the critical understanding to keep questioning and become a leader in your chosen field.
