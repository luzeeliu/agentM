The constantly increasing availability of customer data offers great opportunities to gain managerial insights for attracting new customers and developing and maintaining relationships with existing customers.
This course will equip you with the knowledge required to use data to inform customer relationship management (CRM) practices to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. You will learn how to apply state-of-the-art analytics to manage customers throughout different stages of the customer life cycle. You will also learn how to identify customer segments, forecast customer demand, target customers with marketing initiatives and adopt a value-based CRM approach.
Instead of standard two-hour lectures, the course uses a combination of short lecturing videos and accompanying materials and short interactive sessions. Through short online videos and accompanying materials you will be able to adapt the learning experience to your needs so that you gain a general understanding of typical CRM problems and suitable methods to solve them.
During the short interactive sessions, you will deepen this understanding through case studies, discussions, and quizzes. During lab-based tutorials, you’ll tackle real-world CRM problems exercising hands-on data analytics using R. No prior knowledge of R is needed because this course will go through R step-by-step.
