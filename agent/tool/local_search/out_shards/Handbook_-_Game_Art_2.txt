This course allows you to further develop your practical, technical, and conceptual skills in game art by extending your engagement with real-time workflows and production techniques. Building on your foundational skills and knowledge in game art practice, this course focuses on game art production pipelines so that you can expand the potential of your practice. Emphasis is given to optimising your workflow while also advancing your understandings of user interaction, game logic, and storytelling. You will be encouraged to combine these skillsets as you experiment with game art techniques and concepts to create your own real-time screen-based project. You will also focus on planning and iterating your creative work, to help you develop greater awareness of the relationships between form, content, interactivity, and the production of meaning in game art practice.
