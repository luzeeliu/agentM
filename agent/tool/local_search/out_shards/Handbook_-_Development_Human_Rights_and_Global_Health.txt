This course will analyse the interface of three important global topics: global development, human rights, and global health. Included within this analysis will be the present status of international human rights and international humanitarian law as they apply to global health practice in relation to low and middle income countries.  The course seeks to engage students, scholars, human rights practitioners, health professionals, advocates, development professionals and members of civil society in a dialogue about the reciprocal interaction between global development, human rights, and global health. It will offer tools that stakeholders can use to incorporate a human rights framework into their development and global health practice.
