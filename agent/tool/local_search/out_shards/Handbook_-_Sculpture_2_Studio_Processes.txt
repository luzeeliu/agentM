This course develops your skills and knowledge in 'expanded' sculptural practice through a focus on the iterative and process-based potentials of the medium. Through studio-based learning, you will develop skills in mould making and casting so that you can experiment with producing artworks in series and multiples, as well as create artworks with multiple components. Key themes and processes such as material transformation, translation, mirroring, inversion, and mimicry will be investigated in relation to broader strategies of installation art and considerations of embodied experience. Within this framework, you will be encouraged to investigate a diverse range of materials and processes so that you can develop deeper understandings of your creative interests in contemporary sculptural practices and contexts.
