The French-speaking world represents one of the biggest linguistic zones in the world with an estimated 274 million French-speakers on all 5 continents. In pursuing your study of the language, you are joining a rich, vibrant and diverse community of close to 49 million learners worldwide. This course will be perfect for you if you already have a solid knowledge of French (equivalent to five terms/semesters of studying at university level) and will enable you to not only improve your written and aural comprehension but also to communicate ideas in short essays and discussions. Vocabulary and grammatical structures are presented in the context of culturally relevant issues and your learning will be enhanced with online components designed to make language acquisition faster and more efficient. You will be exposed to many authentic documents, including the press, television and digital media that will help deepen your immersion into Francophone culture and help you get a perspective not far from a native speaker’s.
