The 3981 Bachelor of Aviation in Management program is a 144 UOC undergraduate program offered by UNSW Aviation through the Faculty of Science and resides within a suite of undergraduate aviation programs under UNSW Aviation, including the Bachelor of Aviation in Flying (3980) and the Bachelor of Aviation in Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems.
The aim of the program is to prepare students for a successful career in the aviation industry with a focus on creating effective managers and thought leaders in the sector.
The program has been designed by UNSW Academics and key aviation industry partners and provides students with an opportunity to gain a combination of real-world experience and academic skills providing them with a competitive edge in the market. Strong involvement from industry in the delivery of the program gives students the opportunity to network and engage with industry partners and prospective employers.
Key areas of learning include courses in human factors and safety, aviation economics and finance, aviation management, aviation law and regulation, and aviation and the environment.  The degree is also underpinned by courses that develop students' scientific and soft skills that leverage the technical knowledge learned throughout the program.
Bachelor of Aviation in Management students are also provided with an opportunity to embark on a maximum of two optional minor specialisations from a choice of four key areas in aviation management: Drone Applications, Human Factors and Aviation Safety, Aviation Law and Sustainability, and Aviation Data Analytics, to further refine their learning and provide career direction.
The program involves a minimum of 3 years of full-time study. The rules and requirements of the degree are set out below.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
Credit transfer to program 3981 will depend on the stage at which students transfer from program 3980.  UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.

Internship, Placement and Exchange Opportunities
Bachelor of Aviation (Management) students and Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Aviation (Management) students have the opportunity to use 6 to 12 UoC of Level 3 Prescribed Electives to enrol in Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement courses (AVIA3199, SCIF3000, AVIA3299). If Bachelor of Aviation (Management) students wish to enrol in all three WIL work placement courses offered (18UoC total), additional courses will need to be taken as part of the student's allocated free elective load.

Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing section below for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
