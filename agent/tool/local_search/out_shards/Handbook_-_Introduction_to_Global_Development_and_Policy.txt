We live in an interconnected world, where our global trades, policies such as foreign aid, or social values and practices have an impact, whether at the village level or at a United Nations Security Council meeting.
This introductory course considers global development, policies and practices as processes of change informed by particular ideas of what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. Other major changes come about through external factors: the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and forced migration, climate change and extreme weather events, amongst others. In this course, we explore what drives development interventions, their impacts on communities, the ways they respond, and where resistance occurs. We also explore the processes and influences that operate at a global level and that impact such fundamental concerns as human rights, gender equality, population health, environmental and climate change, and migration.
Through a series of nine key topic areas that form the content of the course, you will learn why development thinking – and by extension development practice – has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learned from past failure and successes. You will leave this course with an appreciation of the complexities of global policy-making and practices, as well as an understanding of what issues and concerns ought to be addressed at local, national, international and global levels.
