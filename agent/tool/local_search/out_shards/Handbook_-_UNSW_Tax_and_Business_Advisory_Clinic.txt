Internship placements in the UNSW Tax and Business Advisory Clinic course fulfil Work Integrated Learning (WIL) and Final Year Synthesis requirements.

During your placement, you will address real-client cases, from conducting interviews to strategic planning, research, drafting documents, and engaging in objections and advocacy where needed. You will contribute to community outreach projects through educational workshops, which will enhance your professional and technical skills, alongside critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and leadership abilities. This experience not only boosts your professional competencies. Your contribution in the Clinic also impacts positively on disadvantaged communities.
