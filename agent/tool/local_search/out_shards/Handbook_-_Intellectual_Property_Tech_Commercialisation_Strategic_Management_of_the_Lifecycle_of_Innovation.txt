This course provides students with a framework for managing intellectual property through the lifecycle of intangible assets. Taking an innovative ‘legal project management’ approach that simulates contemporary legal practice and draws on methods commonly adopted in MBA degrees, the course examines the lifecycle of copyright works, trademarks, patentable inventions, registrable designs, and confidential information. Through a cradle-to-grave examination of key considerations that arise at various points in the commercialisation and management of intangible assets, students will learn how to obtain and preserve long-term competitive advantage through the use of intellectual property law.
