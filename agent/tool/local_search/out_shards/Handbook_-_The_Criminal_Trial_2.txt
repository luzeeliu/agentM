The criminal trial forms a public stage upon which criminal justice is performed. But, what is ‘justice’, and is it really being done? In this course, we place the common law criminal trial on trial to critically explore the dynamics and features that characterise the trial, and the values that underpin it. You will examine the criminal trial from a range of perspectives to gain an understanding of the trial process in Australia. You will then cross-examine the trial using a comparative approach that introduces you to alternative trial systems around the world. Through a close interrogation of the roles, rights and powers of trial participants in different systems, and the varying objectives of criminal trials, you will deliberate and pass judgment on the successes and failures of our criminal trial and consider possibilities for reform.
