As cyber threats become more complex, organisations must take proactive measures to prepare for and prevent potential incidents. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary cybersecurity practices and equip them with the necessary skills to manage and respond to potential cybersecurity incidents. Students will learn how to formulate and prioritise measures to prevent, reduce the impact of, and prepare for a variety of attacks. This includes learning about various cybersecurity controls, frameworks, and best practices that are grounded in data on actual attacks. Additionally, the course will cover methods for implementing cost-effective and efficient automated controls.
Beyond technical aspects, this course will address managerial and organisational issues such as critical incident response, internal and external communication, and refining security frameworks. Students will also learn about the short- and long-term implications of cybersecurity incidents and how to effectively manage and respond to them. These principles, practices, and recommendations can also be applied to a range of critical and adverse situations such as crises and natural disasters.
