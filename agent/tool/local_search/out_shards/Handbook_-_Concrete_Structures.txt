Overview
A course on concrete materials and the design of reinforced concrete structural elements subject to bending, shear and combined bending and axial compression. These include: concrete materials (cements, aggregates and admixtures and hardened concrete properties) concrete mechanical properties, reinforcement types and properties; durability requirements; behaviour of reinforced concrete cross-sections in… For more content click the Read More button below.
A course on concrete materials and the design of reinforced concrete structural elements subject to bending, shear and combined bending and axial compression. These include: concrete materials (cements, aggregates and admixtures and hardened concrete properties) concrete mechanical properties, reinforcement types and properties; durability requirements; behaviour of reinforced concrete cross-sections in bending at both service and ultimate loads; ultimate strength analysis and design of cross-sections in flexure (singly and doubly reinforced, ductility); serviceability analysis and design of beams (cracked section analysis, deflection and crack control); ultimate strength in shear; bond anchorage and curtailment (simple and continuous beams and one-way slabs); short and slender concrete columns (interaction diagrams).
