In the first two years of the vision science course, students gain a strong foundation in optics, perceptual systems and the psychophysical principles of vision science. This course teaches students how to apply this knowledge to solve important real-world problems in optometry, ophthalmology and vision science. Students learn to undertake lighting evaluation using the instrumentation of a fully functioning lighting measurement laboratory. Students learn to minimise important and common optical aberrations in optical dispensing by mastering the principles of computer-aided lens design. The ocular imaging component of this course applies foundation knowledge in anatomy, physiology and optical imaging skills to strengthen understanding of how ophthalmic structure can be imaged to infer visual function. Students learn how image analysis routines can be implemented in software to enhance image structure for the objective and subjective assessment of human vision. These skills are important to understand the research and development lifecycle of ophthalmic imaging which benefits technicians and clinicians including optometrists and orthoptists.
Note:
VISN1221 and VISN2211 are assumed knowledge for this course.
