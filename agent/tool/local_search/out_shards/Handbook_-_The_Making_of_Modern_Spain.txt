In less than half a century, Spain has transformed into a bustling urban metropolis and one of the strongest and more progressive democracies in Europe. Once known for its conservativism and political repression, it has undergone massive social and cultural changes in approaches to gender, family, sexuality, and religion. Yet it also continues to be dogged by its colonial history, by problems of nationalist fervour, and internal conflict with longstanding independence movements in the country. You will be introduced to modern Spain as a country of massive change confronting big questions. Topics explored in this course include family, sexuality and gender, migration and ethnicity, identity, religion, and memory. You will discuss the social, cultural, and political challenges affecting Spain today and be immersed in Spanish culture through its songs, films, and art.
