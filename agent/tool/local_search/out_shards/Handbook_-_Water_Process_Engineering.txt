Water is essential for manufacturing, chemical, food and industrial processes. As a water process engineer, you’ll be an expert in the process engineering that produces safe, clean, and quality water from irrigation to food production, and process water from industrial production or mining. You’ll learn how to apply your knowledge of chemical engineering or environmental engineering to the safe and sustainable handling of water. As a specialist in water process engineering, you’ll understand the chemical engineering contexts of water production and the essential unit operations that are required. You’ll contribute to the sustainability of industry by designing water processing operations that are specific to the industrial and environmental contexts.

2.
Solve engineering problems in the management and processing of water by competent application of technical knowledge in areas including chemistry, microbiology, analytical chemistry, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, transport phenomena, process technologies, separation technologies.
keyboard_arrow_down
3.
Use systems thinking to guide engineering practice, including articulating constraints on process design, resource usage, developing process improvement plans, and liaising with scientists and engineers from other disciplines to develop appropriate and robust processes.
keyboard_arrow_down
4.
Make responsible engineering decisions in the face of uncertainty, complexity, and incomplete information in consultation with stakeholders, via critical reflection, and through the planning, collection, and analysis of data from research, experimentation and simulations.
