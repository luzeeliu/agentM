Space Systems Engineering
provides those studying the engineering of space systems with a grounding in the discipline of systems engineering, applying that body of knowledge to space systems by way of example throughout the course. The course begins by providing a framework within which to develop an understanding of the processes and management practises associated with the systems engineering discipline. The underlying systems engineering process is presented and is shown to be applied repeatedly throughout the entire system lifecycle.  Attention then focuses on the broad topic of systems engineering management and some of the activities normally associated with engineering management are detailed. The course also introduces tools commonly used in systems engineering and details how systems engineering coexists with other disciplines (particularly Project Management, Quality Management and Integrated Logistics Support Management). The systems engineering body of knowledge is reinforced by the use of example and tutorials throughout the course. Students are further practised though a series of individual exercises that reinforce the application of the discipline of systems engineering to the specific nature of space systems.
