Succession is an elective course which depends on a knowledge of Property and Equity. It will thus consolidate your knowledge of property and equity and draw together many other aspects of the undergraduate curriculum in law. The course is designed to serve the intending practitioner and to cover some academic aspects of the law of Succession -that is, the law regarding the transmission of property from one generation to another, usually on death. It is suggested that the best practitioners in this area are those with sufficient intellectual understanding and curiosity to connect different doctrinal areas of law in a way which serves their clients' interests most comprehensively. This includes recognising factors which shape the laws regarding inheritance and recognising where changes in those factors are likely to alter the needs of clients in matters like estate planning.
