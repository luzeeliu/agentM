This course examines a spectrum of dispute resolution methods that have a trans-national or international dimension, ranging from non-adjudicative methods, such as negotiation and mediation, to adjudicative processes, including international arbitration and international litigation. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these methods within complex, cross-border settings, where varied legal, cultural, and procedural challenges arise.
The content will be adapted each time the course is run, but will focus on issues across the life cycle of a dispute, such as:
• Development of international and comparative approaches to dispute resolution, particularly for mediation and arbitration;
• Challenges of managing complex disputes across borders, including enforcing agreements;
• Challenges of resolution of disputes where parties have different cultural backgrounds and come from different legal systems;
• Issues arising out of the multiplication of procedures for the settlement of international disputes.
