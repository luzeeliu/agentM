This is a complete first course in corporate finance that aspires to provide students a holistic view of the principles of financial valuation and financial decision making in action. Building on the fundamental principles of valuation developed in the Integrated First Year (IFY), the course first aims to broaden and deepen students’ theoretical knowledge and practical experience in valuing more complex debt and equity assets than they have valued before. The course then aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between financial risk and return and how this relationship in turn affects the cost of capital, capital structure, and asset values. Finally, the course extends students’ practical knowledge and skills in valuing cash flows and managing working capital. Underpinning the teaching philosophy of the course is the concerted effort to develop financial literacy in the proficient use of Excel modelling, applying these skills in real world situations such as the valuation and evaluation of publicly traded stocks.
