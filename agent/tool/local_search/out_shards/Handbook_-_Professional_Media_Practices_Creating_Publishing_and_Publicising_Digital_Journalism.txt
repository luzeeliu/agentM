Landing a job in journalism today is much easier if you have real experience in the multi-faceted world of digital publishing. This course gives you that experience. Professional Media Practices is a ‘clinic’ in all stages of digital media production, built around hands-on experience producing and publishing content for UNSW’s multi-award-winning online publication, Newsworthy. You will work under the mentorship of the Newsworthy editor to conceive and execute digital journalism ideas across all media types, including the regular Newsworthy podcast. In doing so, you will develop core skills in sub-editing, image editing, and webpage design and layout. Equally important to digital publishing and this course are the backend skills of publicising and disseminating content on social media platforms, using data analytics to tracking engagement, and optimising content for internet search engine results. This course is about getting you work-ready with skills relevant to employment in news media organisations, but also to the communications teams of activist groups, businesses, charities, and government organisations.
