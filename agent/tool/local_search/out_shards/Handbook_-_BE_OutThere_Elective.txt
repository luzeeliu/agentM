This elective is open to all undergraduate students in BE, who are in their third year or above. Students from other Faculties may also enrol. The course provides students with a "service-learning" experience working in an interdisciplinary project context on a challenging social issue. The service-learning approach gives relevance to students' learning by acknowledging that they bring prior knowledge, experience and skills to the project and provides the opportunity to apply and integrate that previous learning to a real-world problem. In the process, the requirements of the project will challenge students to research additional information, share their findings with each other and creatively synthesise a design solution that responds to all aspects of the client's brief.
