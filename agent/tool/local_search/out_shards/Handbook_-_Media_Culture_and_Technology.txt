This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The Media, Culture and Technology major specialisation at UNSW aims to provide you with a progressive, interdisciplinary understanding of the social, cultural and experiential impacts of media and communication technologies in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The major specialisation starts with an accessible introduction to ways of thinking about the emergence and consequences of our contemporary media landscape. You will then progress through a number of pathways and perspectives that move towards the present reality of complex global media, information and communication systems and networks that people access through a variety of digital technologies.
In terms of learning skills, the major specialisation develops conceptual frameworks and modes of analysis through which you can understand and explain not only changes in the media, but also reasons for those changes and their social and affective consequences.
