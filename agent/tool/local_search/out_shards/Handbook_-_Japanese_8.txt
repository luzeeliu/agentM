The course has three phases, which relate to a research project on the Japanese language in order to develop your linguistic knowledge and skills in depth. In the first phase, the course leads you to examine and discuss readings and visual materials presenting various aspects of the characteristics of the language. You refine and expand your knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, expressions,
kanji
, and different styles and registers in Japanese through interactive exercises in both lectures and tutorials. These practices provide you some hints and ideas to opt for your research topic. In the second phase, you prepare a project by exploring a specific area of Japanese you find interesting or useful. After practicing communication strategies and skills, a series of interview sessions for data collection give you opportunities to interact with your peers and native Japanese speakers. In the final phase, you write a paper and present it in Japanese. You use your analytical and critical thinking as well as presentation and academic writing skills. This course is taught in Japanese and with readings in Japanese.
