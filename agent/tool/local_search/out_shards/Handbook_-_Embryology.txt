The lecture content of this course will provide students with a robust understanding of the development of the major organs and organ systems of the human body. Students will also acquire a basic understanding of how major birth abnormalities arise.
In the practical classes, students will actively apply the lecture content by completion of online modules, through modelling of embryonic development using playdough, by digital embryo dissections using online resources, by working with animal models of development in laboratory classes, and in a journal club. Furthermore, students will be exposed to cutting-edge developmental and stem cell biology research presented by experts in the field.
How the course relates to the Medical Sciences Program:
The Embryology course is appropriate for a Medical Sciences pathway that includes anatomy, cell biology, histology, and pathology courses, and it prepares for an Honours project in a developmental biology, stem cell or cancer research lab.
Applications of the Course in Future Careers:
The Embryology course prepares graduates for a wide range of careers. Graduates can apply their knowledge of anatomy and developmental biology directly, such as by choosing a career in the biomedical sphere. Some of these include biomedical research scientist, science educator, policy advisor, IVF scientist and forensic scientist. Alternatively, graduates can use the general skills and knowledge acquired to pursue careers in other areas.
