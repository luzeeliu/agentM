This course engages with key ideas and issues in Chinese Studies. It also re-visions areas that have been covered in other courses in the Major. These include Chinese language studies, literature, film, media, translation, anthropology and gender studies. You are encouraged to reflect upon, review and use the knowledge and language competence acquired from these areas of study and consider how you can utilise them for your academic or career futures. You will gain a more theoretical and historical perspective on China and Chinese Studies. The learning will be facilitated by a range of activities including independent research projects, oral presentations and essay writing. Through the course, you are to learn and reflect on the contexts, methods and histories in which Chinese Studies has been approached; to gain an informed understanding of the key issues and debates about contemporary and historical China; to review and update scholarship on Chinese Studies from an informed, critical and interdisciplinary perspective.
