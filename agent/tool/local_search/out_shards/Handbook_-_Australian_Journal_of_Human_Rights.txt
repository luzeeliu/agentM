The Australian Human Rights Institute breaks silos between academic research and real-world problems to progress human rights. We deliver interdisciplinary, applied research, empowering communities and educating the next generation of human rights leaders.
The
Australian Journal of Human Rights
(AJHR) is a publication of the Australian Human Rights Institute.
The AJHR is Australia's first peer reviewed journal devoted exclusively to human rights development in Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and internationally.  The law journal aims to raise awareness of human rights issues in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region by providing a forum for scholarship and discussion.
The AJHR examines legal aspects of human rights, along with associated philosophical, historical, economic and political considerations, across a range of issues, including aboriginal ownership of land, racial discrimination and vilification, human rights in the criminal justice system, children's rights, homelessness, immigration, asylum and detention, corporate accountability, disability standards and free speech.
Program and Supervision
Interns will be Associate Editors of the journal, playing an active role in the production of one of the Institute’s key publications. You will have the opportunity to develop your analytical, copyediting, proofing and writing skills, and form contacts with leading academics in the human rights field.
As an Associate Editor you will help facilitate the intake, review and publication of contributions to the journal. Amongst your tasks you will:
Screen contributions to the journal
Identify and liaise with potential reviewers
Edit and proof articles, interviews, Current Perspectives pieces and book reviews
Liaise with academics and members of the legal profession
Undertake a range of other tasks connected with the production of the journal, as directed by the Editors.
All interns are also expected to produce a blog post (600-800 words) on a contemporary human rights issue of their choice, to be published on the Institute’s website.
You will work under the supervision of the journal’s Editor in Chief and Managing Editor.
The AJHR’s Editorial Board is comprised of leading human rights academics at UNSW and other Australian universities:
