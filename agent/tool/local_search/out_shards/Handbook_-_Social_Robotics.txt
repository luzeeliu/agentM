A minor in Social Robotics will allow you to acquire specialised design capacity in the interactive space between humans and robotic technology. Social robotics deals with the design and development of robots that interact with humans as their primary function (in Human-Robot Interaction) and is a rapidly growing field already impacting the most vulnerable of human populations.
The minor includes the development of skills in robotic fabrication, working with collaborative robots, and digital fabrication, and these skills are then coupled with ethical and theoretical knowledge as they are applied to building your own robotic prototypes.
At the completion of this minor, you will have a suite of skills and knowledge for designing robotic prototypes in your own practice, or as preparation for post-graduate study in social robotics.
