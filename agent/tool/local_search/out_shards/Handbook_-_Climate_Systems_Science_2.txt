The Climate Systems Science stream is focused on a broad introduction to the science of the Earth's climate system. Students will gain an understanding of the fundamentals of atmospheric science and oceanography while having the option of focusing their studies in areas such as climate change and risks, land processes, hydrology, biogeochemistry or environmental and resource management.
Courses are designed to highlight the interrelated nature of climate system components and give students the ability to critically analyse problems in multi-disciplinary science context. Students will also develop an ability to undertake directed research.
