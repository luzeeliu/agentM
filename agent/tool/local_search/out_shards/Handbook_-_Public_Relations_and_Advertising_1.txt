This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Specialising in Public Relations & Advertising as part of your Bachelor of Media at UNSW will provide you with practical skills, knowledges and experience you need for a career in the exciting and dynamic promotional industries.
Choosing from a focused set of courses, you will gain practical experience and a critical perspective on advertising, public relations, and communication. This allows you to balance developing core skills in the strategy and tactics of persuasion with building expertise in specific professional domains such as branding or crisis communication. Ethics and justice are woven into the fabric of our courses, so you’ll be able to bring a strong understanding of diversity and difference to whatever work you pursue.
When you graduate, you’ll have the skills you need to get a job and make a difference right away, but also with the critical perspective to be a leader in the ever-changing professional landscape of public relations and advertising.
