The need for new functional molecules is greater than ever, with ever-growing demand for new therapeutics and materials for the future. Via lectures, workshops and labs, the course will focus on developing key skills in making complicated organic molecules from simple building blocks, and transforming one organic molecule to another using the synthetic toolbox. The concept of retrosynthetic analysis, a logic-based tool that uses pattern recognition and mechanistic understanding for the design of synthetic pathways, will be taught and illustrated with classic case studies, including the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules. Students will be trained in modern synthetic methodologies and their application in industry to solve real world problems. This course is intended for Year 3 students. The course has been designed to integrate skills developed in previous courses during the first two years across three main areas:
- Synthetically useful and industrially relevant reactions;
- Reactive intermediates and their utilization in organic synthesis;and
- Retrosynthetic analysis: how an organic chemist goes about designing a practical synthesis of complex molecules.
