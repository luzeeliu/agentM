Taken together, the accounting course in the compulsory core (DPBS1501) and this accounting course (DPBS1511) form an integrated study program designed to give students an understanding of the way in which financial information is generated and used, and to provide an appropriate platform for further study in accounting. On completion the first year accounting courses seek to develop students’: technical competence in recording economic events in the accounting system; a critical understanding of key technical terms and concepts so as to interpret accounting information and reports in the financial press; an ability to argue a reasoned position on key questions of accounting theory and practice; and familiarity with institutional structures that affect the practice of accounting. Topics covered in this course will include accounting for non-current assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, balance sheet and income statement preparation, cash flow statements, ratio analysis, accounting policy choice and further detail on management accounting (including costing systems and budgeting).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
