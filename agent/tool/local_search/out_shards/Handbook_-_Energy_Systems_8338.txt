Energy systems engineering is undergoing a renaissance due to the introduction of smart grids (intelligent power supply systems), the growing need to interface renewable energy generation sources with the conventional electricity grid, and the increasing use of electric motors in everything from smartphones to hybrid cars to satellites.
The Energy Systems specialisation is underpinned by the attainment of disciplinary and advanced disciplinary knowledge, and the undertaking of an enquiry-based learning component. This specialisation offers a broad range of theoretical- and applications-based electives within the discipline of energy and power systems engineering, including smart-grids, power electronics for renewable energy engineering, power system analysis and protection, high voltage engineering, power systems planning and economics, and electrical safety. Such a choice allows students the gain a depth and breadth of knowledge across several themes.
The specialisation provides a solid postgraduate program for electrical engineers wishing to upgrade their skills or further their knowledge.
