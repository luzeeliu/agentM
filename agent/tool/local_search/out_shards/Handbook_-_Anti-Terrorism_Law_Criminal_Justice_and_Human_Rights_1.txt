This subject aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of Australian anti-terrorism law and situate that in a theoretical and comparative context. Students will acquire specific knowledge about particular aspects of the legislative counter-terrorism framework arrived at by the Commonwealth with the agreement of States and self-governing Territories. In doing so, students will also gain an understanding of how these reflect or are discordant with the theoretical arguments around the securing of the state and the preservation of important civil liberties such as freedom of movement, association and speech. The role of the judiciary and legislature as checks upon executive overreach in responding to the threat of terrorism is also a theme throughout the course.
