This course builds on MATH1131 or MATH1141 to provide a solid foundation for further study in mathematics for students in STEM disciplines. It is taken by undergraduate students typically in their first year. The Calculus half of the course covers partial derivatives and multivariable chain rules, further techniques of integration and applications of integration, ordinary differential equations, sequences, series and Taylor series. The Linear Algebra half of the course introduces abstract linear algebra, covering vector spaces and linear transformations and eigenvalue and eigenvectors. In addition, there is a topic on probability distributions. Technology is used throughout the course through use of the Maple computer algebra system and students producing a typeset assignment that focuses on written communication skills.
MATH1231 has a higher version, MATH1241, that has greater depth and a greater emphasis on proof and rigorous argument than MATH1231.
