In this course, you will explore the way people experience and interact with space, connecting this with ideas of the body, materiality, culture and spectacle. You will learn to design spatial, time-based and atmospheric conditions that affect engagement with the built world.
The course offers multi-dimensional exploration of spatial experience that incorporates ideas from philosophy, architecture and neuroscience to better understand, anticipate and design for human behaviour. Through the design of installations you are invited to experiment, examine, measure and critically interpret space, time and narratives with an emphasis on the investigation of social, cultural, ethical and environmental sustainability issues and practices. You will work with diverse design and presentation methods to develop skills and techniques that communicate your ideas.
Advanced study in this discipline can lead to careers in exhibition and event design as well as pathways centred on your own inquiry-led design practice.
