Chemical engineering is a profession that applies theory and skills to the design, development, and operation of unit operations in complex systems, like process plants. It is critical that chemical engineers can characterise and explain the behaviour of these systems under real conditions. In this course, you will continue that journey by conducting a series of experiments on various types of equipment – from pumps, heat exchangers, reactors, to membrane process.
Working in very small groups, you will consolidate your understanding of basic chemical engineering principles and develop your skills in planning and conducting experiments and also  in data acquisition, presentation and analysis. Through accompanying cycles of communicating findings and receiving frequent feedback, you will improve your writing, presentation and critical analytical skills.
You will leave this course with a deeper understanding of unit operations and greater competence in experimental and professional practice.
