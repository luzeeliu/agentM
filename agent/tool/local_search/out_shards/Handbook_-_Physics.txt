The Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Physics is comprised of 48 units of credit. It requires studying higher-level coursework and completion of an independent research project, under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The Honours year commences in Term 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. Term 3 entry may also be available. Part-time enrolment, commencing Term 1 only, may be available.
Students complete 24 UOC of coursework by enrolling in PHYS4141 Quantum Mechanics (Honours) 6 UOC and PHYS4142 Statistical Physics (Honours) 6 UOC in Term 1, and PHYS4143 Topics in Contemporary Physics 12 UOC in Term 2. The Term 1 courses are assessed via assignments worth 40% and exams worth 60% of the final mark. In PHYS4143 students will take two of the four lecture modules offered in modern physics. These are assessed via a presentation (10%), assignments (30%) and final exam (60%). Coursework contributes 50% towards a student’s final grade for honours.
The other 50% of a Physics honours mark comes from completion of an original research project, conducted over three terms. Students complete 24 UOC of research by enrolling in PHYS4144 Physics Honours Research A 6 UOC in Term 1, PHYS4145 Physics Honours Research B 6 UOC in Term 2 and PHYS4146 Physics Honours Research C 12 UOC in Term 3. Projects are offered in all areas of research in the School: Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Music Acoustics and Theoretical Physics. Projects are also offered by academics in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. A list of projects and supervisors will be available in the term before students begin honours. Students are assessed by submission of a research proposal, literature review, and final thesis. The research proposal is worth 10%, the literature review contributes 20% and the thesis contributes 70% to the final research mark. These will be marked by two assessors within the School, one of whom will be the student's supervisor. Students are required to give a short talk about their research at the end of the year, but this is not assessable.

Additional Information
Honours grade calculations
At the completion of their Honours program students will be awarded an honours grading based on their WAM for that year (weighted average mark) as follows:
Honours Class 1: WAM of 85 or greater;
Honours Class 2 Division 1: WAM from 75 to 84;
Honours Class 2 Division 2: WAM from 65 to 74;
Honours Class 3 or Pass: WAM below 65.
High performing students may be recommended for a university medal.
Admission requirements
Students who have completed an undergraduate degree with a major in physics or physical science, and who have maintained a WAM of 65% or higher are eligible to apply for Physics honours. Students must have also taken at least 24 UOC of Level 3 Physics courses including PHYS3111 Quantum Mechanics; PHYS3113 Thermal Physics and Statistical Mechanics; and PHYS3114 Electrodynamics (or equivalent). Students who do not have these prerequisite courses may be eligible to apply for the Graduate Diploma (Research) or the Master of Philosophy.
Pathways
Students who complete an Honours program and achieve an Honours Class 1 or Class 2 Division 1 are eligible to apply for higher degree research programs (a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) or Masters by Research (MSc)). Students with Honours Class 1 are also eligible to apply for research scholarships such as the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship. Students who have completed Honours in Physics have also gone onto careers in areas such as commercial and government research, teaching, scientific sales and management, and financial and data analysis.
