This course looks at ways in which business processes can be analysed, redesigned, and improved. A business process is a set of activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organizations. Business Process Management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, administration, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes. BPM is concerned with the explicit representation of processes – once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to coordinate business process activities.
By taking this course you will be able to understand business process from a general management perspective, and learn tools, analytical frameworks and general principles for managing business processes. The course will incorporate a laboratory component using BPM software.
