This course will provide students with an introduction to the study of constitutional law through a comparative lens. It will begin with an introduction to the field, exploring questions such as how do you study a “constitution”, what is the value of studying constitutions comparatively, and how do you decide which countries to study (including discussion of the ‘Global South’ critique within comparative constitutional studies). It will cover a range of topics in constitutional law from a comparative angle, including forms of government, federalism, democracy, rights protection, judicial review, and constitutional change, as well as exploring the transnational dimensions of constitutional law. A week will also be devoted to an exploration of contemporary constitutional changes, challenges and conversations taking place in our region, focusing on particular case studies in Asia and/or Oceania. This course is for students who are interested in deepening their understanding of constitutional law through comparative study. Students are encouraged to take Law in the Global Context and Federal Constitutional Law prior to or simultaneously with this course.
