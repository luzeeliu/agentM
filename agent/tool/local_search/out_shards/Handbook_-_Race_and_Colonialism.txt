There are (at least) two sides to the colonial relationship. In this class we focus on the ways in which colonialism is enmeshed with White knowledge traditions and cultures so that we can better understand the complex relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. Students will be introduced to key concepts and thinkers in the fields of Critical Race and Whiteness theory and together we will apply them to everyday experience and popular culture.
