In this course, you will be introduced to the latest theories and methods in the study of urban multilingualism. You will develop an understanding of the role languages other than English play in multicultural and multilingual communities, explore how people maintain and use their heritage language in Australia and how language use is shaped by societal attitudes and ideologies. You will gain fieldwork skills in linguistics through an innovative project collecting empirical data from diverse language domains (e.g. markets, cafes, libraries) about public signs in languages other than English and develop a critical understanding of how multilingualism can be interlinked with social justice in the everyday life of speech communities and individuals. The project will equip you with practical and research skills for working with communities, making use of census data and interviewing skills. The course can be useful for any career which requires critical and analytical skills in multicultural and multilingual contexts.
