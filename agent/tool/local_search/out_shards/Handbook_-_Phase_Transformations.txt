This course introduces students to the various transformations that occur in metals, ceramics, and polymers, emphasising how transformations may be exploited to manipulate the microstructure of these materials, thereby enhancing their processability, properties, and performance.
The course begins by discussing the limitations of phase equilibria and introducing key concepts such as time, driving force, and interfaces to explain transformation mechanisms. It utilises fundamental principles of thermodynamics, diffusion, and reaction kinetics to elucidate phase nucleation and growth, overall transformation kinetics, microstructural development, non-equilibrium phase formation, and the origin of isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams.
The course then covers the principles of solidification, including cast structure development, microsegregation, interface stability, single crystal growth, glass formation, and devitrification, through to the mechanisms of solid-state, diffusional and non-diffusional transformations and the formation of precipitates, pearlite, bainite, martensite, ordered domains, and recrystallized microstructures.
Students will learn throughout the course how transformations play a vital role in modern materials manufacturing, such as continuous casting of metals, semiconductor fabrication, polymer processing, glass manufacturing, materials welding, additive manufacturing, and thermal and mechanical processing.
The course includes lectures, problem-solving sessions, assignments, and tests.
Previous knowledge of thermodynamics, phase equilibria, and transport phenomena is required.
