This Level 4 course in materials science and engineering will teach students to apply the factors influencing the selection of a material for a specific application. Building on the processing-structure-property relationships of materials taught in earlier class-specific materials courses, students will apply this knowledge by examining possible candidates from all material classes in conjunction with environmental, sustainability, economic, ethical, health and safety, and other societal factors for justifying selection of appropriate materials. This approach will highlight the inherent compromises in the materials selection process, balancing design requirements with available material property profiles.
The course will cover a range of topics, including methodologies for materials selection, the important concept of ecological footprint in materials selection, and how a material’s life cycle contributes to this footprint.  The course will introduce methods for measuring and minimising the ecological footprint, making use of advanced approaches and analysis methods to select appropriate materials and processing routes based on economic and other factors. With this knowledge and skills, students will be able to select the most suitable material(s) for a given application, taking a holistic view of the numerous factors that impact the materials selection process.
The course includes lectures, tutorials, computer laboratories, site tours, group project work, presentations, assignments, and exams. Students will use commercial software packages to gain experience using life-cycle assessment and materials selection programs.
Knowledge of the processing-structure-property relationships of metals, ceramics, polymers, and their composites is recommended.
