The purpose of Honours within the Discipline of Industrial Design is to enable students who have performed well at undergraduate level in an Industrial Design or aligned program area an opportunity to undertake a substantial individual project of research and design exploration, the equivalent of an Honours thesis. Building upon the  disciplinary foundation in knowledge, literacy and skills of the Bachelors degree, the Honours year enables academic excellence, social engagement and global perspective to a level where graduates are prepared for transition to professional practice. The Honours program is also a  means of connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students who may wish to a Masters by research or a PhD program.
