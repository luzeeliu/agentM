The course provides a general understanding of economic geology. Tied with useful working knowledge of the formation of different ore deposits, this course will assist students in the development of appropriate mine planning, design decisions, and to conduct an economic feasibility study.
The course teaches a range of geological data collection and major exploration techniques used in the Australian and international minerals industries for discovering and characterising major orebodies and mineral deposits. The potential application of such techniques, as well as their limitations, are discussed to inform the usefulness and appropriate application of such techniques in the industry.
The course introduces the essential integration paths between geology and mining engineering – both in terms of the information collected and how it is applied, as well as the interaction of the professional staff involved.
Furthermore, students will have the opportunity for hands-on learning through fieldwork and relevant software packages.
* The sections of this course covering the fundamentals of geology, including minerals, rock types, tectonics, geological structures, stress fields, discontinuities, and geological mapping, will be co-taught with MERE2002.
