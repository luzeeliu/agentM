MATH1031 provides a foundation in techniques in Calculus and Linear Algebra used for mathematical modelling in the life sciences and other disciplines. Applications are presented in interdisciplinary contexts through lectures, videos, and tutorial exercises. This course enhances students’ analytical thinking and problem-solving skills through illustrative examples in lectures, problem-based tutorials and an assignment. Communication skills are developed through active participation in tutorials, by writing clear and logical arguments in the assignment and when solving tutorial problems.
This course is designed for students who need to use mathematical techniques for applications in the life and social sciences and other disciplines and who do not intend to continue to further studies in Mathematics. Although students who do intend to study Mathematics beyond first year can take MATH1031 as a preparation for MATH1131, which does provide the foundation for further study in mathematics.
