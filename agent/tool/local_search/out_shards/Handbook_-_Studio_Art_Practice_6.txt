Studio Art Practice 6 is the sixth in a sequence of six core courses that enables you to develop your independent artistic practice. This course builds on Studio Art Practice 1-5, and provides opportunities for you to deepen your self-initiated work through practice-led research. As it is the final course in the sequence, you are encouraged to follow the materials, processes, and ideas that are fundamental to your practice, and to cultivate a deep engagement with your creative interests. Through structured and semi-structured studio classes, you are given opportunities to plan, develop, and resolve your works in peer-to-peer contexts. You are expected to regularly contribute to and lead class discussions and group critiques. With a particular focus on the discourses that shape contemporary art practice, the weekly topics and examples provided are responsive to the individual and collective needs of the class. Professional contexts and standards are also scaffolded into the course so as to help prepare you for future pathways.
