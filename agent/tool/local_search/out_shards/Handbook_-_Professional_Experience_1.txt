This is a hybrid course. It is available to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The course content, delivery and assessment will be identical for both groups of students.
In this course you will develop a range of teaching skills and understandings essential to plan for and manage successful classrooms. You will complete an orientation and a range of online activities, followed by a 4-week (i.e., 20 consecutive days) supervised professional experience placement in a NSW school. Through ongoing observation, supervised teaching, and contribution to the wider school community, the course ensures you work towards the achievement of the national standards for a graduate teacher. You will gain an understanding of the range of activities that occur both inside and outside the classroom and the roles of the teaching and non-teaching staff within the school.
Note
: In order to undertake professional experience placements, you must: meet eligibility criteria; understand the policies and procedures that apply to professional experience placements; and provide satisfactory evidence of the NSW Mandatory Compliance Documentation (via InPlace).
