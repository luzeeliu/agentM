Planning Thesis: Research Design provides a comprehensive and rigorous foundation for self-directed research. Your final year in the BCP (Hons) provides the opportunity to bring together your specific urban planning interests to design and undertake a major piece of research and complete a thesis. The course helps you to develop your early research ideas into a well-considered research proposal and commence the research itself. You will be guided through all steps in the research process, including turning areas of interest into feasible research questions, identifying suitable research methods and ensuring consideration is given to ethical research design and conduct. Your research and analytical skillset will be refreshed as you determine an appropriate research approach. Towards the end of term, you will be allocated a thesis supervisor who becomes your primary contact as you start to undertake your research and prepare your thesis.
