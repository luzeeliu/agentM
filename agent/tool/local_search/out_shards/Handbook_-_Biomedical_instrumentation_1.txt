This course serves as an introduction to physiological measurement of bioelectric phenomena and neurostimulation. This course deals primarily with gaining an understanding of the physical principles which govern the measurement of a biological variable or system, by a transducer which converts the variable into an electrical signal. By the end of the course you should understand various measurement devices and approaches including the underlying biological process that generates the quantity to be measured or controlled. The basic medical instrumentation used clinically to perform these functions is also examined. This course has a focus on bioelectric phenomena, bioelectrodes, medical electronics and neurostimulation. The course includes a revision of DC and AC circuit theory, hands-on practice in the use and testing of medical transducers and electromedical equipment in common use in hospitals and research laboratories to make measurements of biomedical variables of clinical significance.
