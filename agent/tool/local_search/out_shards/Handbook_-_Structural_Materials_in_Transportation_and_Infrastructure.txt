This Level 4 elective course in materials science and engineering introduces students to advanced manufacturing processes of structural materials used in current and future transport and infrastructure applications.
The course will cover structural engineering alloys such as advanced steels, specialty alloys, and select non-ferrous alloys, state-of-the-art construction materials, and various composite materials. Specifically, students will learn about the fundamentals of processing of advanced structural materials via advanced manufacturing routes, which may include subtractive manufacturing such as sintering, strip casting, and thermomechanical processing, and additive manufacturing such as 3D printing.  The course content and activities will provide the students with the skills to design innovative manufacturing processes and state-of-the-art structural materials in terms of property requirements, sustainability, cost, and ethical principles.
The course content will be delivered through a series of flipped lectures based on online materials and standard lectures delivered by guest speakers from industry and academia. It also includes laboratory work focused on manufacturing of selected structural materials to achieve superior properties and a major group project on the current practices in manufacturing processes of structural materials for selected applications in either transport or infrastructure.
Previous knowledge of the processing-structure-property relationships of metals, ceramics, polymers, and their composites is recommended.
