MARK3054 helps you to understand the use of analytical tools in marketing, and develop your capabilities of using analytical tools to address marketing problems – key skills that numerous companies have stated they look for in marketers, particularly in challenging business environments.
This course builds on your basic statistical skills (e.g., statistical distribution, t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression), and exposes you to a range of statistical tools and techniques typically used in marketing nowadays. You will also get a chance to see what big data techniques can do in marketing, and learn a few basic big data techniques. The emphasis is not on formulae of statistical tools, but on how to apply and interpret a range of statistical techniques to help answer marketing-related questions.
The course is organised around daily marketing problems. You are strongly encouraged to start thinking as marketers by asking questions of your data, setting your own direction for the analysis in the project and thinking about how a company could utilise the results in practice.
