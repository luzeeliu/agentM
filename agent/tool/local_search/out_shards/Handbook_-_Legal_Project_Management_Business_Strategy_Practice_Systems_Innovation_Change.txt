Legal services are delivered within an operational context that imposes various constraints – such as (but not limited to) budgets, delivery timeframes, client expectations, resourcing challenges and professional obligations. Legal Project Management (LPM) is the application of project management concepts and skills to the delivery of legal services, in such a way that helps lawyers identify and proactively manage these constraints. LPM is widely adopted across top-tier law firms and leading in-house legal teams, who recognise the operational, client and employee benefits that LPM delivers.
This course examines the foundational areas of LPM, and provides students with hands-on experience in applying these within practical legal service settings. These areas include:
Scoping, planning, pricing and estimating (i.e. ‘matter management’)
Teams, leadership and communication
Risk and quality management
Process optimisation, systems thinking and design thinking
Data and legal technology
Change management
Aspiring lawyers will gain expertise that make them more 'work-ready', whilst practicing lawyers and legal executives will up-skill in core capabilities that underpin successful legal service delivery.
