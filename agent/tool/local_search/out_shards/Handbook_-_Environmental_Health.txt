This is an introductory course on Environmental Health. The overall aim of this course is to stimulate a broad understanding of Environmental Health and the important contribution of public health knowledge and principles in addressing pressing environmental issues, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. We will chart the evolution of Environmental Health as a discipline, from occupational and environmental health in the mid-19th century through to Environmental Justice and Ecohealth of the 20th century, to One Health and Planetary Health in the 21st century. We will take a lifecourse approach, examining the importance of various different environmental conditions on health and wellbeing at birth, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and the senior years. Some of these environmental conditions include air pollution, pesticide, water contamination, green space, food environment and noise. The course will be suitable for students who wish to gain a basic grounding in Environmental Health.
