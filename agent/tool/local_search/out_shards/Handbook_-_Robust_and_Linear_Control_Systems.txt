Linear and robust control systems are important areas of modern control engineering. It is important that control engineers are able to model, analyze, and design linear and robust control systems and develop effective control solutions to achieve better system performance.
The course covers basic topics of linear and robust control such as continuous and discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, discrete-time approximations, controllability, canonical forms, pole placement, observability, Lyapunov stability applied to linear systems, basic robustness, sensitivity and complementary sensitivity, classical loop shaping, single-input and single-output (SISO) controller design using polynomial methods, singular value decomposition,  optimal control, the optimal linear regulator (discrete, continuous), model predictive control, Kalman filter and predictor (discrete, continuous), advanced robustness, disturbance rejection, H-infinity control and state estimation.
