This course focuses on some of the most fundamental applications of drones (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems) – the capture and processing of remote sensing data and imagery for applications such as aerial surveying and mapping, search and rescue, cinematography, environmental monitoring and more. Students will learn essential workflows for drone imagery and information systems such as risk management, flight planning, remote piloting, and the capture and post-processing of collected data using different techniques. Through a combination of interactive lectures and hands-on tutorials, students will learn how to apply the introduced knowledge to their own real-world flying, data acquisition, and post-processing for specific challenges. This course is designed for any students with an interest in drones or applied robotics.
