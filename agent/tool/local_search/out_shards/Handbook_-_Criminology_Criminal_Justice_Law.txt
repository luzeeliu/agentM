This Handbook is for commencing students. If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law and Justice for advice.
This program provides students with an opportunity to obtain two degrees of professional importance to the public sector, criminal justice, community service, business and law practice. Career opportunities include criminal justice agencies such as the Attorney-General's department, Police, Prisons; Customs; ASIO; Magistrates, District and Supreme Courts; Australian Bureau of Statistics; and practising as a criminal law barrister. In addition, graduates may also undertake analytical and research work in a wide range of areas from aspects of law such as sentencing and punishment to the social causes of a range of crimes from domestic violence to terrorism.
The Bachelor of Criminology & Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real world focus designed to explore your interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. Criminologists tackle 'real world' social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, indigenous justice, organised crime and corrections. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. The UNSW BCCJ also provides you with the skills of applied social research and policy analysis.
