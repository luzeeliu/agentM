Do you want to understand cultural experience? This interdisciplinary social science gateway course equips you with foundational knowledge in sociology and development studies that will help you to understand some of the key social challenges the world is grappling with such as power and inequality, human security, human mobility, human rights, and globalisation. The course will help you develop the conceptual and analytical skills to situate these topics within their broader cultural contexts, and guide you to closely examine taken for granted assumptions and ideas about them.  In this course, you will explore the lived experience of people and cultures around the world and how they make meaning, sensitising you to intercultural understanding. On completion of the course, you will have a general understanding of the social forces that make us human, make us different and will help you to navigate complexity in an ever-changing world.  Themes, concepts, theoretical and analytical frameworks introduced this course will provide you with a solid foundation for studying in one of the many social sciences disciplines.
