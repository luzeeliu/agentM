This course examines the way drug policy is made in Australia and internationally and the impact this policy has in the community, including on people who use drugs. The course draws on research from critical policy studies, critical drug scholarship and critical criminology to explore the often complex politics that rest behind the formation, implementation and enforcement of drug policy, and the differential impacts these politics can have in society. It will ask you to critically appraise the role of evidence in policy, and interrogate ideas around addiction, race, class and reform as they relate to drugs, drug use, and drug policy. The course will draw on a series of contemporary case studies, ranging from treatment and service delivery, event safety, overdose prevention, violence in the drug market, stigma and more.
