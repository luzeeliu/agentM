This course provides a set of statistical tools and research designs that are useful in conducting empirical research in applied microeconomics and related fields. Because of the importance of economic research with direct policy implications, the focus will be on methods for estimating causal effects. We will critically discuss various techniques and indicate strengths and weaknesses. We will review several different approaches to program evaluation and apply these methods to real data, in the context of policies and programs in a broad range of areas including development, labour markets, health care, political economy, social welfare and poverty, education, and crime. The course will equip students with the necessary knowledge to be able to conduct program evaluations and to be informed consumers of such research.
