How are chemicals and materials made?
As chemical engineers, understanding how chemical materials and energy move from raw materials to the final product in a multistep process is the very heart of this discipline (CLO4, 5). By adopting this as a way of thinking, a chemical engineer can identify and design more energy efficient and environmentally friendly processes, reduce waste, optimize process flows and make financial savings (CLO5). In the same vein as the popular catchphrase ‘follow the money’, this course aims to equip you with a set of powerful tools and strategies to ‘follow the material and energy’ in a chemical process plant (CLO1, 2, 3). These are foundational skills for your future.
Specifically, you will learn how to apply thermodynamic concepts with material and energy balances to chemical process problems involving several unit operations and involving chemical reactions. This will include study of the first and second law of thermodynamics, vapour liquid equilibria for pure and mixed components, heats of phase change, heats of reaction and example applications such as refrigeration and power plants.
