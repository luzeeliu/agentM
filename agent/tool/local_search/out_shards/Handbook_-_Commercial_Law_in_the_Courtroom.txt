This elective provides students with an opportunity to learn or develop further advocacy skills in the context of a simulated commercial trial in a superior court. The primary assessment consists of a series of moots reflecting important stages in a commercial proceeding, including interlocutory hearings, witness examination and closing submissions, based on a problem question involving areas of law such as contract law and misleading or deceptive conduct. Students will learn how the parts of a commercial matter fit together, and will be required to reflect on their own and others’ oral advocacy.
It is recommended, but not required, that students have completed LAWS1230 Lawyers, Ethics and Justice.
