The aim of this course is to prepare Honours and Ph.D. students to do research in Empirical Corporate Finance. The course is organised around published and working papers in the field with an emphasis on econometric methods and the publication process. Rather than providing an exhaustive overview of the field, the course focuses in depth on selected topics to illustrate different empirical approaches. Using papers on from various sub-fields of corporate finance, the course will attempt to expose students to issues of identification, endogeneity, and instruments. The course will also attempt to strengthen your ability to digest and critique academic research. Finally, it will help improve your presentation skills through constructive feedback.
