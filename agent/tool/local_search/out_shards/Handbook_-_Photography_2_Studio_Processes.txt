This course builds your skills and knowledge across analogue and digital processes in contemporary art practice by introducing you to colour photographic theories and processes, medium format cameras, and the photographic lighting studio. Working with directorial photography on location and in the studio, you will explore and analyse the technical and conceptual relationships between photography, colour, and light.
