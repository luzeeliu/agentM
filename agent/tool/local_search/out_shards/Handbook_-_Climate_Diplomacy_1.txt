This course, offered in advance of the recurring United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP), provides an in-depth exploration of global legal frameworks and climate diplomacy. Students will engage with key climate treaties and negotiations, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the legal mechanisms driving global climate policy.
The course examines the role of various stakeholders in climate governance, including state and non-state actors, and explores implementation and compliance mechanisms within the international climate regime. Guest speakers with firsthand experience in climate negotiations will provide valuable insights into the practical aspects of climate diplomacy.
Through case studies and simulations, students will learn how to develop and implement legal strategies in international forums, including understanding coalition-building, strategic positioning, and effective advocacy techniques.
By the end of this course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of climate diplomacy, advocate for vulnerable nations, and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.
This course is ideal for law students interested in international environmental law, climate policy, and diplomatic practice, especially those considering careers in international organizations, government, or advocacy groups focused on climate justice.
