Sociology offers a critical perspective on the societies and social worlds in which we live. It gives us the necessary tools to analyse the structures and institutions that shape our everyday lives, and to understand the role of power, inequality, and cultural difference in social relationships.  Doing a minor in Sociology will give you an invaluable social and cross-cultural perspective that will support your major area of study whether it be another social science, humanities or arts-based discipline. If you are majoring in business or science, a minor in Sociology will give you greater depth and cross-cultural breadth. If you are majoring in a discipline that is concerned with social and cultural trends, a minor in Sociology will improve your analytical skills, your conceptual understanding, and your appreciation of ethical relations. Most importantly, sociology will change the way you see the world and your place within it.
