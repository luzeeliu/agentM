Description
This course provides an introduction to the underlying processes that lead to the development of disease in the ocular system. The role of microorganisms in the development of infection, of the immune system in the development of inflammation and autoimmunity, and of genetic predispositions leading the inherited diseases will be discussed to provide a foundation in disease pathophysiology. This course will also present diseases which affect the eye and associated structures with regards to their underlying pathophysiology leading to the clinical presentation. Students will become versed with appropriate medical terminology to accurately describe the signs and symptoms of diseases, and develop their ability to conduct differential diagnosis by integrating case presentations with epidemiological knowledge.
