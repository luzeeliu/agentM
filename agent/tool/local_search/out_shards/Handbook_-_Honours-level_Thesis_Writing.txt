This Honours-level seminar course is designed to introduce you to higher-level academic research and writing in the disciplines of Creative Writing, English, Film, Media, Music, and Theatre & Performance Studies. It will extend the writing skills developed in the first three years of the degree to support the preparation and completion of your first major piece of independent research – the Honours thesis and/or production project. It will introduce you to core issues in and approaches to research which will help you consolidate and extend their understanding of their chosen discipline and of the place of their research within it. The course is organised around a structured seminar series, beginning with a consideration of the nature of disciplinary research in the Humanities and moving on to consider the genre of the Honours thesis, and to developing a Research Plan and Thesis and/or project timetable.
