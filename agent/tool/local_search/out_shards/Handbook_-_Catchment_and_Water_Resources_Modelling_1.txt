Overview
How should catchment models be formulated? How should model parameters be assessed? How could these parameters be assessed when in-situ streamflow data is absent? How can hydrologic models be designed using physics alone (without calibration parameters)? How could such models simulate streamflow in future (warmer) climates? How could simulated streamflow… For more content click the Read More button below.
How should catchment models be formulated? How should model parameters be assessed? How could these parameters be assessed when in-situ streamflow data is absent? How can hydrologic models be designed using physics alone (without calibration parameters)? How could such models simulate streamflow in future (warmer) climates? How could simulated streamflow be used for decision making (including sizing and forming reservoir operation policies)? How can future climate simulations be enhanced by quantifying and removing systematic biases? These are the key questions the course seeks to address.
