Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC.
Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) (144 UOC)
At least one approved Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) major
SCIF1001 and SCIF2001
48 UOC Honours year
Science elective courses
Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) (96 UOC)
A Bachelor of Computer Science major; and
Computer Science elective courses
In this dual degree students take 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours), and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Science (Computer Science), for a total of 240 UOC. The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Advanced Science (Honours) major there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.
In some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically:
- Students must complete MATH1141 and MATH1241 or higher versions.
