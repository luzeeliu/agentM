Signal Processing permeates a great range of applications in every day life. It aims to manipulate signals in order to shape, transmit or extract information. It provides a fundamental set of tools for applications such as communications, sensing, navigation, image and video processing, biomedical and health applications, as well as the control of power systems. This course builds on the third-year signal processing course to broaden the scope of the students' knowledge and to provide deeper insights into the theory that underlies them. The topics covered include:
FIR Lattice filters, All-pole IIR Lattice filters and their implementation; Fixed Point or finite word length implementations and effects; Random Processes, Auto-correlation, cross-correlation, and power spectrum estimation techniques; Least squares filter design, Adaptive filters, Wiener filters, adaptive noise cancellation; Linear prediction, statistical and deterministic formulation. Applications of linear prediction. Time frequency analysis:short-time Fourier transform, quadrature mirror filter banks, multilevel filter banks and wavelet transform.
