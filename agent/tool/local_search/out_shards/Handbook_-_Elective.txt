OBJECTIVES - The Elective course provides students the opportunity to  further develop knowledge and skills in any discipline in another environment to  experience a different pattern of health care delivery. This may be taken in any  school or department within the Faculty of Medicine; or in a hospital or medical  institution, with a medical practitioner, with a community health organisation  or a research facility in Australia or in another country.
Students  should make individual arrangements for electives and are advised that some  overseas universities, governments, health authorities and/or hospitals require  very early applications, accompanied by certification that the applicant is an  enrolled medical student of the University who is eligible to undertake the  specified term. When making the arrangements, students should specifically  request that an appropriate person is willing to act as a  supervisor.
ASSESSMENT - Each student is required to produce a report  which describes the nature of the work done during the Elective Course. This  should be approximately 1000 words in length. The supervisor is also asked to  submit a report.
