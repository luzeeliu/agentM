Industrial Design Studio 3A prepares you for industry practice by working on projects that consider commercial requirements and constraints. The studio course highlights the necessity for an iterative but structured design process within a commercial framework. You will gain further experience in applying design research methodologies to produce outcomes that address technical and manufacturing constraints while at the same time prioritising social, consumer and market needs. You will engage in practical projects that parallel industry processes, with each undertaking having a strong emphasis on innovation, technical resolution, and high-level design documentation to a professional standard. A rigorous and responsible approach to product design is fostered by addressing real-world consumer, environmental, social, commercial, technological, and manufacturing needs.
