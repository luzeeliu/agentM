Nutrition encompasses not only individual health but also the well-being of entire populations. This course aims to expand upon your comprehensive grasp of the foundational science underpinning human nutrition on the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of life. Through this course, you will develop the skills necessary to extrapolate methodologies employed in assessing the nutritional status of individuals to broader demographic groups.
Measurement tools such as anthropometry, dietary analysis, and biochemical and clinical evaluations will be interpreted to gauge the nutritional needs of populations, including vulnerable population groups like women, children, and the elderly through specific topics. You will learn how evidence-based data is developed to influence national food and nutrition policies. You will also understand other tools used to measure absorption and utilization of nutrients from diets.
The topics will also delve into the realm of nutritional epidemiology through an understanding of different food systems while critically analysing scientific literature and honing communication skills for disseminating research findings effectively. Engaging in discussions surrounding sustainable development goals (SDGs) linked to population well-being, you will strategize on achieving these objectives particularly addressing SDG 1,2 and 3. Additionally, collaborative group activities will empower you to design and propose nutrition intervention programs tailored to diverse food and nutrition landscapes across countries.
