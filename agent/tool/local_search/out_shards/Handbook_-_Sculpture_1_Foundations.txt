Expanded sculpture practices and conversations play a central role in the contemporary art world today in Australia and internationally. This course introduces you to the foundations of this field, from the process of making objects and assemblages, to the role of the body, space and time in installation and performance practices. Studio presentations featuring images of artist practices will outline developments in sculptural practice from the 1950s to the present day. Discussions emphasise the ways in which artists address concepts and context through their choice of materials and forms. In workshop sessions that support class time, you will develop basic skills working with materials. You will transfer and build on these skills in the studio through project work and employ tools for contextualising, documenting and reviewing your practice, including a process journal and digital platforms. Your learning and critical thinking is supported by regular group and individual studio critiques with feedback and guidance from the tutor and input from peers. The course features opportunities for collaboration and encourages you to use the studio setting as a dynamic site for experimentation and exchange on issues in art and society today.
