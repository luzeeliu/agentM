This is the first introductory course into the discipline of transport engineering as part of the broad field of civil and environmental engineering. An outline of the field of transport engineering and its relationships with other engineering and non-engineering disciplines is provided within the course. The basic concepts and terminology of the discipline is introduced. The course comprises of two strands.
The first strand of the course covers the first 5 weeks of the session.  This section of the course is concerned with the analysis, design, and evaluation of traffic and network systems, including the basics of traffic flow theory and the steps of the regional transport planning process. The lectures and workshops will provide an opportunity to learn the engineering properties of traffic streams along with relevant measurement and network analysis techniques.
The second strand of the course covers analysis methods required for sustainable transport engineering. This includes technical skills required for the evaluation and management of environmental impacts from transport projects, including estimation of vehicle air pollutant emissions, energy consumption, and travel demand management. The course covers the application of planning concepts in the development of economically sustainable transport systems including lifecycle and cost-benefit analyses. Additionally, estimation of noise levels and engineering solutions to control noise is covered in the context of transport noise generators such as road traffic.
