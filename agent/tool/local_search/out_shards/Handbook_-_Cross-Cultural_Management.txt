‘Cross-Cultural Management’ provides you with an understanding of the contextual knowledge, cross cultural skills and varying perspectives required to manage and work across borders and cultures in a changing global business environment. The course provides conceptual frameworks for systematically understanding the notion of culture, cultural synergies and differences, and the convergence and divergence in cultural norms and values. It incorporates topics that highlight the impact of culture in the international business environment, explores the multiple dimensions of culture and considers the implications for management. The course will also draw attention to more recent developments in the global business environment, especially in relation to emerging economies and the developing world, and the implications for international business and management. Through problem based learning, authentic case studies and critical analysis, the course explores practical solutions for managing in cross cultural business contexts.
