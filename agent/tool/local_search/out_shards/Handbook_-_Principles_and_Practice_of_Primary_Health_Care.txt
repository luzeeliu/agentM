Around the world health systems are struggling to cope with ageing populations, rising rates of chronic disease, increasing demands on health services. Primary health care focuses on prevention, early intervention, and community-based care across the span of people’s lives. Can it hold the key to unlocking a healthier and more equitable future for all?
Primary health care is a critical component of all health systems, with the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Primary Health Care is also a major focus of health care reform in Australia and overseas. The Principles and Practice of Primary Health Care course provides an introduction to the principles of primary health care and their application in the delivery of health care in the community. The integration between primary health care and specialised and hospital care is also examined. You will learn practical skills in appraising the design and delivery of primary health care services and identifying opportunities for change.
