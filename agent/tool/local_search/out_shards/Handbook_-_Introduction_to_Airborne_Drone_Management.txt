Airborne drones (unmanned aerial vehicles (or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)) of varying shapes and sizes are permeating the civil aviation sector across recreational, commercial and research activities. This is due to their ability to perform certain processes for numerous industries such as medicine, military, humanitarian aid, retail, and construction in safer and more efficient ways than crewed air flight. The professional ability to safely and efficiently operate and manage airborne drones requires fundamental aviation knowledge. This course will introduce these fundamentals of RPA management to students through a suite of topics including basic aeronautical knowledge, RPA ethics and law, human factors and safety, logistics and operations, and RPA research methods. The course will emphasise practical applications of the concepts and tools introduced through select case studies and realistic mission planning for operations involving commercial and research activities. The course is delivered fully online with asynchronous, interactive, self-paced content each week. In addition, course staff will be available online for an optional live drop-in tutorial class each week for students to ask questions and clarify understanding.
