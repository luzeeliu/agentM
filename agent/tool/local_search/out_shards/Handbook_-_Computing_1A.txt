From recent innovations in AI like self-driving cars to humanoid robotics navigating complex environments, leapfrogs in battery technology to sequencing the human genome - the world is benefiting and evolving thanks to computer systems. At the core of all these systems are computers executing instructions to solve exciting problems.
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of how we instruct computers to solve problems. You will explore the architecture and mechanics of how computers operate and how you can translate real-world problems to computer programs that solve these problems.
The concepts you learn will provide a foundation for your future endeavours in computing and, we hope, will begin to change the way you think about real-world problems.
