Biotechnology innovation is in a large part driven by the requirement for improvements in medical diagnosis and therapy for a range of diseases including autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation and cancer. Innovations in biomolecular therapies such as recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, nucleic acid therapies, stem cells and novel bioinspired materials have and will continue to improve available medical treatments for many conditions. The course is designed to give students a detailed insight into the principles and techniques leading to these innovations. The practical work includes production of a model recombinant biopharmaceutical by cell culture, including downstream processing and characterization using modern techniques of analytical biotechnology including mass spectrometry. On‐line bioinformatics tutorials and assignments associated with model biopharmaceuticals and other biotherapeutics are included in the practical program.
