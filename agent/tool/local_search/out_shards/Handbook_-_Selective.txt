Students may choose from a range of clinical attachments in any of the core disciplines or in other areas of clinical practice offered by the clinical schools. Students may also organise a selective course with the approval of the relevant school, including campus-based schools. Each attachment should be a minimum of 4 weeks. The attachments must be in sites affiliated with UNSW.
OBJECTIVES - Students should choose selective attachments to:
- improve their knowledge and skills in areas in which they require further development;
- broaden and complement their previous experience in one of the core disciplines;
- obtain experience in a specific area relating to future career interests.
Learning will be based primarily on clinical experiences during the selective attachment. Students would be expected to participate in the clinical unit's teaching activities.
Assessment will include satisfactory completion of the generic learning plan and observed patient assessments (if applicable to attachment).
