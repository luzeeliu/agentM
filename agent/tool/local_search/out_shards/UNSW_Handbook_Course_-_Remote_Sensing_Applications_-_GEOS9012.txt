Description
Using a diverse range of case studies, this course demonstrates broad remote sensing applications in forestry, agriculture, natural resource management, wildlife conservation, environmental change, pedology, oceanography, geology, meteorology, and politics. Specific applications relate to the assessment of tropical and sub-tropical land cover change, ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycles, vegetation biophysical properties, wetlands management and monitoring, fire, pollution, urban studies and cold region hydrology. Computer-based laboratories allow the students to explore a range of optical, thermal and radar data appropriate to particular applications, and provide exposure to practical image processing and interpretation techniques including classification, change detection, formulation of indices and derivation of empirical relationships. Practical experience with IDL ENVI and Erdas Imagine is provided.
