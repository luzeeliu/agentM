This course expands your skills and knowledge in drawing by focusing on the imaginative, narrative, abstract, and spatial potentials of the medium. Throughout the course, you will critically engage with historical, contemporary, and culturally diverse drawing systems to explore the medium's capacities for spatial construction and pictorial representation. The course also encourages you to draw influence from other artists’ ideas, techniques, and processes, as well as engage with critical debates about contemporary drawing.
