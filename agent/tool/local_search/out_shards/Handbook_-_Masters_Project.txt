The biomedical engineering masters project (BIOM9914) allows coursework students to experience research training either within the School or with collaborating institutions such as hospitals and CSIRO. Projects are selected by the student in consultation with a supervisor conducting research in an area of interest to the student. If the research topic selected is external to the School/University, the student must arrange for an internal GSBmE co-supervisor/assessor.
This is a course for the postgraduate masters research projects to be undertaken in 1 term and is suitable for high performing and motivated students. It consists of 12 UOC. Candidates should complete the thesis proposal form in consultation with a GSBME supervisor who will act as their supervisor before enrolling. A second co-supervisor/assessor must also be nominated on this application. All thesis proposal forms must be approved by the Course Coordinator prior to enrolment.
Projects are assessed on the basis of a project report in the format of either a thesis or a research paper ready for submission to a refereed journal or refereed conference papers (to be published in full in the proceedings). A poster presentation is also required.
