Studio Art Practice 4 is the fourth in a sequence of six core courses that enables you to develop your independent artistic practice. This course builds on Studio Art Practice 1-3, and helps you to extend your individual practice by connecting it with other artistic, social, and cultural contexts. Through a series of structured and semi-structured studio classes, you are encouraged to consider how your work can engage with contexts in and out of the studio. Field trips and fieldwork supplement class discussions and making activities to allow you to explore how artistic processes can move beyond the familiar surroundings of the studio. Weekly topics and diverse examples also help provide frameworks for you to creatively and critically explore assumptions about where and how art is made. With increasing emphasis on class discussions and group critiques, you are supported in developing your studio vocabularies and peer-to-peer skills.
