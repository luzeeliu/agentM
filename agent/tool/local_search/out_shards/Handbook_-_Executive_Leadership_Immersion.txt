This course constitutes the final course of the capstone year for the MBA (Executive) Program. The course provides the opportunity to consolidate learnings from the MBA (Executive) journey and particularly the courses that constitute the capstone.
It will do so by reflecting on your own (growth, innovation and transformational) development journey and how that has shaped your identity as a capable leader of self, of other individuals and of organisations. You will also use that understanding of your own developmental journey to shape a personal vision of 'where to from here' as the successful completion of the MBA (Executive) Program is merely one milestone, albeit a memorable one, on your ongoing journey.
The course is structured around the concept of a client project, for which you will be collaborating with a First Nations business or community organisation. In order to do so effectively, you will develop your cultural awareness, learn about supplier diversity, and learn about leadership from First Nations leaders.
The course includes a residential component, which will be an immersive experience (possibly outside of the Sydney metropolitan area with a First Nations community or communities) and offers a final challenge to explore your perception of your identity as a leader in a challenging and unfamiliar context. The details and setting of the immersive experience may vary between classes.
