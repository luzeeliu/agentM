This course is integral to the Integrated First Year of your degree and builds on what you have already learned.
COMM1100 explored the fundamental decisions managers need to make to keep the organisation running successfully and did so from the perspective of a structured environment. However, businesses do not operate in isolation: an organisation and the decisions their managers make exist in broader, often complex and dynamic environments.
COMM1150 now introduces the interplay of organizations with their environmental contexts to achieve both commercial and societal value. It prompts students to investigate global business environments with economic, legal, political, socio-cultural, and sustainability lenses to sense disruptions and opportunities. This aim includes understanding the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UNSW’s commitment to them.
