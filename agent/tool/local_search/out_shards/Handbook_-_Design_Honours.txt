The Design (Honours) program is a 48 UOC (one year equivalent) advanced undergraduate degree for high achieving students. The program is designed for those who have completed an undergraduate degree in Design (or cognate area), and wish to extend their critical and creative skills in Design. The Design (Hons) enables students to advance their knowledge and understanding of design practice by developing a significant practice-led research project. Access to the School of Art & Design’s leading research labs and a selective professional placement program allow students to explore the potential of design in the 21st Century.
Supported by coursework in design theory and professional practice, the program supports students to gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between theory and practice in contemporary design and the role of design in social challenges. Graduates of the program have a developed understanding of design strategy, design methods and research for design, on design and through design, providing career pathways to design consultancy, innovation or a diverse array of professional and career outcomes in the design and cultural sectors as well as pathways to higher degree research programs such as an MPhil or PhD.
