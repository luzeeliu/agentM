The School of Optometry and Vision Science offers an honours stream in Vision Science. The school's approach to honours is to provide initial training for future leaders in vision science. Honours in Vision Science provides students the opportunity to engage in sustained research in order to develop advanced disciplinary knowledge in Vision Science, the use of specialised techniques relevant to their chosen research area, critical thinking, evaluation and synthesis of information for scientific research communication in both oral and written forms. These skills and the learning objectives will form the basis for future pursuits in vision research and research and development in the ophthalmic industry.
Students will also have the opportunity to:
Use effective communication skills to present information in a convincing manner
Show Strong information literacy skills by conducting an analytical literature review
Work effectively to explore a research topic
By the end of the program, students will be able to:
Conduct a thorough literature review
Design and implement a research plan
Collect and analyse data
Present an oral presentation at a research seminar
Write a scientific paper

Assessment
Assessments are completed in the 16 UOC (per term) course
VISN4016 Vision Science Honours
.
1) The Vaegan Memorial Seminar series and journal club attendance
Fortnightly research seminar presentations (1 hr) by postgraduate students, staff members and visiting academics. In addition weekly journal clubs are held by staff members in the school in which research articles are presented and informally reviewed. Students are required to present at journal club. No assessment is given, but 75% attendance for both components is required for successful completion of the honours program in the School of Optometry and Vision Science.
2) Tutorials or Workshops - 10% to the final honours grade
Fortnightly workshops (2-3hrs) which covers topics such as ethics, research design, statistics and data analysis, thesis writing and synthesis, presentation skills and professional development. Fornightly exercises (e.g., quizzes, problem based learning examples and case studies) will be given and students will be required to submit them for assessment.
3) Literature review and Research proposal - 20% to the final honours grade
The literature review will be marked by the supervisor based on:
Demonstrated knowledge of topic area
Content and organisation, coverage of key issues
Depth and breath of analysis and discussion
4) Seminar Presentation - 10% to the final honours grade
Presentation of project results and conclusions. Assessed on scientific content and communication clarity and style
5) Written Research Report - 60% to the final honours grade
This report will be marked by two independent assessors in the school or elsewhere when expertise is needed. This assessment is based on:
Depth and breadth of discussion
Content of report, coverage of key issues
Appropriate use of figures and tables
Correctness and appropriate use of reference
Organisation, clarity and format in appropriate scientific style
Honours Calculation
The school will use the following guide as grade to honours
Hons. Class I (>85%)
Work of superior quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, demonstrating the ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, the integration of information from a wide range of sources and containing clear examples of excellent critical evaluation.
Hons. Class II, Division I (75% to 84%)
Work of very good quality in all aspects of research , scientific writing and oral presentation, but showing lesser ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, integrate information from a range of sources and critically evaluate the literature and research data.
Hons. Class II, Division 2 (64% to 74%)
Good quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, but with inadequacies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.
Hons. Class III (50% to 64%)
Adequate quality work with significant deficiencies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.
Admissions Requirement and Process
An undergraduate bachelor degree (AQF level 7, from UNSW, or at other institutions) with content and specialisation in Vision Science (e.g., a Bachelor of Vision Science, or a Bachelor degree with a major in Vision Science) and an indicative average mark of credit (equivalent to a 65 WAM).
Students must enrol full-time in VISN4016 in three consecutive terms of study. Students must make contact with potential supervisors and gain approval from the Honours Coordinator. Following this, students should contact student admissions and complete an honours application form before the due date (typically February for T1 and May for T2 and September for T3).
Pathways
After the completion of honours, students may be qualified to enrol in higher degree research such as postgraduate level studies Master of Science (MSc) by research or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Students demonstrating outstanding performance in their honours year may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) to support their studies.
