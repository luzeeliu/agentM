Business leaders in international business participate in shaping the global context. As they seek new opportunities to increase the impact of their business, they are also held responsible for the impact of their decisions on the natural environment and on social justice. Failing to do so, will put the company’s legitimacy and future at risk. Navigating a multi-national multicultural environment, business leaders need to be cognisant of the fact that these responsibilities are interpreted differently in different places around the world.
This specialisation prepares students to take responsibility for these challenges in their future workplaces. They will be equipped with the business knowledge, skills, and mindsets to design business models that can generate sustainable value for businesses, as well as for society at large; to measure and report societal impact; and, to collaborate with governments and civil society to address the world’s grand challenges.
