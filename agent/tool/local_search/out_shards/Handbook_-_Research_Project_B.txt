Students who have completed COMP9991 in their penultimate term of study in MIT (8543) and achieved a mark of at least 75 have the option to, in their last term of study, complete COMP9992. Unless they scored at least 85 in COMP9991, they do not have the option to select COMP9993. Also, rather than following up with COMP9992, they can instead enrol in COMP9990, would they wish so, or would they have to in case they scored less than 75 in COMP9991. The supervisor will make sure that the project is possibly restricted so it is equivalent to completing 1 standard course, in particular in the case of a student who is eligible to enrol in COMP9993 but who prefers to follow up with COMP9992.
COMP9992 is expected to require a workload that is roughly equivalent to that of one standard course, but a research project being more open ended and tackled by very motivated students, it might turn out to be more time consuming.
Meeting the expectations of COMP9991 + COMP9992, or even better, exceeding them with a piece of work that can result in a conference or journal publication, can make applications for a research degree stronger. COMP9991 has also been appealing to students who wanted to modestly improve on the state of the art in a particular discipline and be exposed to the various aspects of conducting research, working on a specific problem; COMP9992 completes that journey.
