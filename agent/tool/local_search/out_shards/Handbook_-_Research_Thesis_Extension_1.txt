Research is the agent for generating new knowledge about our world, creating the basis for new innovations, and transforming professional practice. Today, research in the School of Chemical Engineering is transforming how we feed the world, treat disease, produce resources and consumer products, and power our economy. In Research Thesis Extension you will deepen and/or broaden the scope of your research project.
As with your other Research courses, you will integrate your discipline knowledge and skills learned through academic study and professional experience at an advanced level. You will apply your specialised cognitive and technical skills to innovatively solve problems and/or generate knowledge in chemical engineering, food science and related disciplines.
The project you will extend in this course addresses a complex, open-ended problem that allows room for the creative, critical and reflective acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. From your previous research course, you found there were multiple possible solutions or interpretations, and that the problem required you to carefully design and manage the project to reach a successful conclusion. The development of insights and/or solutions for this problem is furthered through this course.
If you are considering a research career and/or pursuing a research degree (such as a PhD), then this course is especially for you. Research Thesis Extension provides an authentic experience of the higher degree environment through the supervisor-student relationship and leads to the production of a draft journal paper. As such there are constraints on who can enrol in this course.
