Description
The Geographies of the Asia-Pacific introduces a region that is as diverse as it is vast.  The course draws on geography's renewed interest in locality, or context specificity.  These 'new location studies' are informed by the 'cultural turn' and link broader structures to processes in local settings.
This course aims to encapsulate some of the shared histories, the various experiences of colonisations, and some of the more contemporary consequences, as well as provide details about the uniqueness of context, of places and peoples.
