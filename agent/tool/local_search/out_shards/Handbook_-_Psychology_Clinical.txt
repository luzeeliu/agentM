Compulsory Training Component
The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) Accreditation Standards require candidates in this program to complete a minimum of 1000 hours in professional placements.
Progression Requirements
Each Professional and Ethical Practice (PEP) course is linked with either 1) pre-requisite clinical training workshops or 2) satisfactory progress on or successful completion of a professional placement. Until the pre-requisite clinical training workshops or any professional placement component of a PEP course have been successfully completed (or satisfactory progress has been made), a PE grade will be applied to the course. Failure to meet placement requirements and/or successfully complete the placement (as determined by both the Placement Coordinator and Program Director) will lead to failure of the PEP course. If the pre-requisite clinical training workshops or any professional placement is not completed to a satisfactory standard, or placement requirements have not been met, a UF grade will be applied to the PEP course. Hours from a professional placement that is not completed to a satisfactory standard will NOT count towards the minimum 1000 hours of supervised practical placement experience required for completion of the program.
Should a student fail a course*, approval to re-enrol in the failed course will be at the discretion of the Program Director (and Placement Coordinator, in the case of PEP courses)^. If approval is not granted, the Program Director may recommend discontinuation from the program.
* Any of the 16 courses required for the program, including thesis and PEP courses.
^ In Australia, the psychology profession is regulated by the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act as overseen by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). The School of Psychology is responsible for adhering to federally legislated professional and accreditation standards for training provisionally registered psychologists in full compliance with the APS Code of Ethics and Ethical Guidelines. Master of Psychology students, as provisionally registered psychologists, are expected to display the competencies, professionalism and reputable behaviours the discipline demands. In making their recommendation, the Program Director will consider these factors not simply from an academic standpoint, but as the discipline's chief authority on such professional and ethical matters within the program.
Should a student disagree with a recommendation made by the Program Director, their avenue of appeal will be to the Head of School and/or School Board.

Study load and duration
The program does not strictly follow the University’s academic calendar, meaning that trainees should expect to have commitments prior to official teaching period start dates and past official teaching period end dates. A modified progression may be negotiated in close consultation with the program team.
Professional Placement
Each Professional and Ethical Practice (PEP) course is linked with either 1) pre-requisite clinical training workshops or 2) satisfactory progress on or successful completion of a professional placement. Until the pre-requisite clinical training workshops or any professional placement component of a PEP course have been successfully completed (or satisfactory progress has been made), a PE grade will be applied to the course. Failure to meet placement requirements and/or successfully complete the placement (as determined by both the Placement Coordinator and Program Director) will lead to failure of the PEP course. If the pre-requisite clinical training workshops or any professional placement is not completed to a satisfactory standard, or placement requirements have not been met, a UF grade will be applied to the PEP course. Hours from a professional placement that is not completed to a satisfactory standard will NOT count towards the minimum 1000 hours of supervised practical placement experience required for completion of the program.
Course Fail
Should a student fail any course, approval to re-enrol in the failed course will be at the discretion of the Program Director (and Placement Coordinator, in the case of PEP courses)^. If approval is not granted, the Program Director may recommend discontinuation from the program.
