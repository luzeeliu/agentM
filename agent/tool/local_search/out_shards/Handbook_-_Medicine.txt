UNSW Medicine offers a six year integrated Medicine program (288 UOC) which leads to the awards of Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMed) and Doctor of Medicine (MD).
The program includes a compulsory Independent Learning Project (30 UOC) to ensure that all graduates acquire knowledge of research principles and methods applicable to Medicine and its professional practice.
The objectives of the Medicine program are:
To establish an integrated, interconnected and organised medical knowledge base as a platform for a professional and personal life of learning through experience.
To develop effective interactions with oneself through reflection; interaction with others through communication; and interaction with information and learning resources through information literacy and critical analysis.
To develop a set of personal attributes and skills appropriate to the professional practice of Medicine.
The program is organised into two degrees:
Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMed)
The BMed includes Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 commences with the Foundations course, followed by 7 x 8 week courses focussing on basic medical sciences in relation to the human life cycle; social, ethical and legal issues related to health care; and early experience in clinical or other health-related environments. During this phase, students will undertake a variety of learning activities involving students from different stages of the program working collaboratively in small groups.
Phase 2 consists of 2 x 16-week courses, with increased clinical content and an emphasis on correlation between prior and current learning.
Doctor of Medicine (MD)
The MD includes the Independent Learning Project (ILP), followed by a Clinical Transition Course prior to the Phase 3 courses. During the Independent Learning Project students should also complete 12 UOC of General Education courses in a faculty or faculties other than Medicine.
Phase 3 consists of 10 x 8-week courses with a clinical focus, but still includes relevant content from the basic medical sciences and the social sciences. Students are required to complete a course in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Children's Health (Paediatrics). Students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete Phase 3 requirements. In addition, a student's clinical experiences during Phase 3 must include a minimum of 4 weeks in a rural location. All clinical courses in Phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached.
Students who have achieved a high standard in the BMed may undertake a one year program of supervised research leading to the award of the BSc(Med) Honours. Students wishing to undertake a full year of research may be able to enrol in the BSc (Med) Honours program 3831 subject to the approval from the Honours Committee. These students will be exempt from undertaking the Independent Learning Project. Exemption from the Independent Learning Project will also be granted to students who have previously completed a research Honours program or higher research degree, or a Master degree with a significant research component, or who can otherwise demonstrate acceptable evidence of independent study or research at a tertiary level.

The majority of students are admitted into Medicine following a selection process based on academic merit, performance in the UMAT and performance at an interview. Only students selected for entry into Medicine can enrol in the BMed program.
A limited number of students in the BMedSc program at UNSW may apply for entry into the Medicine program. Students offered a provisional place at the end of second year will undertake a plan of study specific to entry to UNSW Medicine including a number of bridging courses in conjunction with their Honours research project. After entry into Medicine, the students will complete the Phase 2 Integrated Clinical Studies courses and all Phase 3 courses.

Criminal records check
keyboard_arrow_down
The New South Wales Department of Health has a policy that all students undertaking clinical placements (which includes all Teaching Hospitals used by UNSW in its Medicine Program) must undergo an Australian National Criminal Record Check prior to placement in the NSW Health System.
Students must note that clinical placement in the NSW Health System is a substantial and essential element in the UNSW Medicine Program. Students who fail to satisfy the requirements of this criminal record check at any point during their enrolment will be excluded from the Program. Depending upon the circumstances at the time, students may be eligible to transfer to another Program of the University. Students currently living overseas are also required to undergo a criminal record check from their country of residence.
Medical assessment
keyboard_arrow_down
In order to be enrolled in the UNSW Medicine program, you must comply with UNSW Medicine’s Immunisation and Blood-borne Viruses Policy, available at https://med.unsw.edu.au/policies
Other
keyboard_arrow_down
There are many different stakeholders involved in this degree, including the NSW Government, public and private hospitals and community practices, each with their own policies/procedures and all medical students must comply with NSW Health requirements before commencing clinical/hospital placements.  Because medical students will be accessing various health facilities, it is very important they are familiar with both UNSW Medicine and NSW Health policies.  All Medicine Program students must at all times during enrolment be registered with the Medical Board of Australia , in accordance with the Medical Practice Act 1992. Registration at the commencement of Year 1 will be organised by the Medicine Education and Student Office. Please read detailed information at: https://med.unsw.edu.au/policies
Compulsory Training Component
In all phases of the program, students will be required to travel to various clinical environments associated with UNSW, which will be the predominant locations for learning in Phases 2 and 3. These locations include Clinical Schools associated with St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst; St George Hospital, Kogarah; the Randwick Campus Hospitals; various locations in the South Western Sydney Clinical School based around Liverpool; and the Rural Clinical School, which has campuses in the Greater Murray and Mid-North coast areas. Throughout the program, students may be attached to multiple sites, which will typically include at least 4 weeks in a non-metropolitan setting.
Progression Requirements
Assessment in this program is capability based, requiring students to demonstrate their ongoing development with respect to the eight areas of capability. Progression will not be based solely on satisfactory completion of individual courses, nor will it correspond solely to annual stages. Full details are available on the Faculty of Medicine website.
All students selected for entry into Medicine will have to complete both the BMed and MD. Students who are unable to complete either the BMed or MD may apply for transfer to the BSc (Med) depending on the stage of withdrawal from Medicine.
