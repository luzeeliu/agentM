The ways in which work can affect people's health, safety and well-being are important considerations for all organisations. Accordingly, an understanding of workplace safety issues is important for students pursuing careers in any industry. This course explores current methodologies, frameworks and issues of best practice in the prevention and management of workplace hazards. The course uses a variety of media for course material and assessment, including websites, videos and case studies, and builds on students’ own workplace experiences. It is anticipated that students will gain an appreciation of current legislation and codes of practice, identify different types of workplace hazards and understand how they can affect people; and be able to apply the risk management approach to workplace hazards.
Important notes:
This course is jointly taught with GENS5013, with Science students required to take the AVIA3013 version of the course. Both Aviation and non-Aviation based examples are used in the course.
