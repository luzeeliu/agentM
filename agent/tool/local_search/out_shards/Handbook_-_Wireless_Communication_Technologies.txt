Wireless communication technologies define how to efficiently, reliably, and securely transmit and receive information via electromagnetic waves over the air without wires, cables, or any other electrical conductors.  In this modern and digital era, wireless communications have become an integral part of daily life for everyone, including GPS, Wi-Fi, digital TV, wireless payment, cellular mobile phones (4G and 5G), Internet of Things (IoT), and Bluetooth. It is growing to be more important in the digital society as it facilitates easy information sharing and allows freedom to roam around the globe.
TELE4651 is a 4th-year course in Telecommunication Engineering. It provides detailed knowledge of the fundamental concepts in wireless communications and in-depth discussions on several selected areas, namely, digital transmission and receiving techniques, antenna diversity techniques, wideband transmissions and receiving with software-defined radio (SDR) designs. It includes signal processing for wireless communications, modulation, demodulation, Nyquist pulse shapes, maximum likelihood detection, error performance, symbol synchronization and time recovery, frame synchronization, channel estimation, and equalization. Then it expands to time-variant multipath fading, Doppler shift, shadowing effect, time selective channel, frequency selective channel, and the effects of fading on wireless transmission. It also introduces narrowband and wideband transmissions technologies including space diversity, time diversity and frequency diversity techniques, direct spread-spectrum communications, DS-CDMA, frequency hopping, OFDM techniques, single-carrier-FDE, linear least squares estimation, frequency offset, SDR designs, and their applications.
