The Graduate Diploma in Flying (GDF) is a program designed to meet the needs of graduates with an ambition toward a career as a professional pilot. Students may undertake the GDF as a standalone program, otherwise, it can be taken as a concurrent program with the Bachelor of Aviation (Management). Students from the Bachelor of Aviation Management who wish to enrol in the GDF are advised to contact the School of Aviation before Term 2 of their first year to organise enrolment in Flight Screening.
The GDF incorporates training and assessment for a Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and an Instrument Rating (IR), including academic study covering the underpinning theory. Award of the GDF requires the satisfactory completion of all courses, with the award of the CPL and the IR forming part of the assessment for the program.
The program has been designed by UNSW Academics and key aviation industry partners and provides students with an opportunity to gain real-world experience, which includes being directly mentored by professional pilots in the industry. In addition, students also have the opportunity to kickstart their flying careers through optional involvement in the Qantas - Aviation Career Enrichment Program (Q-ACE). Q-ACE is designed by Qantas to support students at UNSW to develop professional skills and behaviours by presentations delivered during second year. After completion of Q-ACE, students are provided a pathway at Qantas recruiting to update their aviation experience for employment consideration.
