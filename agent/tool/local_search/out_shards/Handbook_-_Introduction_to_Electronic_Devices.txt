Overview
Electronic devices play a crucial role in the conversion of renewable energy sources into usable forms of electricity. Solar panels, for instance, generate direct current (DC) electricity, which needs to be converted into alternating current (AC) electricity for residential and grid use.

Electronic devices play a crucial role in the conversion of renewable energy sources into usable forms of electricity. Solar panels, for instance, generate direct current (DC) electricity, which needs to be converted into alternating current (AC) electricity for residential and grid use. Similarly, wind turbines produce AC electricity with varying frequencies, which must be transformed into fixed frequency AC voltage and current to align with the electricity grid. Semiconductor electronic devices are the key components in facilitating these energy transformations.
In this course, you will delve into the fundamental physics behind semiconductor devices commonly employed in the conversion of renewable energy into usable electrical power. You will enhance your understanding by simulating and analysing these devices using a device modelling software called PC1D. Additionally, you will explore the application of semiconductor devices in various electronic circuits that are critical for efficient energy conversion. Through the use of circuit simulation software, you will design and evaluate solar cells, DC-DC converters, and inverters.
Upon completion of this course, you will possess the ability to comprehensively explain the mechanisms of semiconductor devices, their applications in electronic circuits, as well as their advantages and limitations. Armed with this knowledge, you will be well-equipped to tackle practical challenges in your future career as a renewable energy or photovoltaic engineer.
Embark on this exciting educational journey and unlock the skills necessary to thrive at the intersection of technology and sustainable energy!
