In taking this course, students will be provided with tasks and assignments that will aid in refining their ability to evaluate the value of IS and deploy them strategically to improve businesses. The tasks and assignments will also enhance their professional competencies, which include communication, teamwork, project management and research skills.
The topics covered in this course include understanding the role of Information Systems and IS Professionals in businesses, the relationship between systems, organisations and strategy, the nature and purpose of information systems, the analysis and improvement of business processes, and the emerging trends in IS.
