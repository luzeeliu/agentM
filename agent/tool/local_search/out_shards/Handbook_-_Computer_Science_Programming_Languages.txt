Programming languages form the underpinnings of all software development. Over the years, computer scientists have identified a number of major programming paradigms and developed a wide variety of programming languages based on these, ranging from general purpose languages to application specific languages. The study of programming languages gives valuable insights into the nature of computation in all of its manifestations.
The Programming Languages stream in the Computer Science program exposes students to the foundations of programming languages, how they are designed, how they are implemented, and how they might best be exploited by programmers.The stream considers procedural languages, functional languages, object-oriented languages and parallel languages.
