Airline operations are defined as the functional areas which are directly associated with the operations of the aircraft and in the provision of operational support services. There is much overlap between the management of “corporate” and “operational” aspects of an airline. This occurs mainly in the planning processes such as fleet planning, schedule planning, and strategic planning (including business plans and annual budgets).
This course provides a comprehensive overview of important processes and factors related to airline resource management including engineering, maintenance and crew resource planning; airport planning, emergency planning, operations control, and punctuality management; airline management; environmental matters and freight; planning, budgeting, staff and equipment rostering; disruption management; and the management of aircraft, crew (both technical and cabin service crew), and inflight service functions.
This course is complementary to AVIA5009 Airline Corporate Management which is also provided in the Master of Aviation Management and Graduate Diploma in Aviation Management programs. The introductory module of this course provides a brief overview of the corporate side of airline management and its relationship with the subsequent modules.
