Description
This course will cover the basic principles of pharmacology with an emphasis on drug action from the molecular and cellular levels to tissue, organ and whole animal levels. The course will provide an understanding of the principles of drug action (pharmacodynamics) in terms of drug chemistry, drug-receptor interaction, receptor theory and dose-response relationships. An introduction to receptor-mediated signal transduction, membrane receptors and autonomic pharmacology will be covered. The handling of drugs by the body through the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (Pharmacokinetics) will be covered in some detail along with drug analysis and the adverse effects of drugs. Aspects of clinical trials, legal aspects of drug registration and the principles of toxicology will be introduced. The laboratory classes will involve basic pharmacological and toxicological methods.
