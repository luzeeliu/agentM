This intermediate course within the Interaction Disciplinary Studio will introduce you to the formal methodologies of interaction design. Building on the principles and practices acquired in the introductory course, a holistic, situated approach to technology will be used as a framework to look at how new designs work and are used in industry. The focus of this course will be the rapid development of testable prototypes to conduct formal user evaluation studies. Thus, informing future revisions and iterations of an ever-evolving design. You will investigate case studies to understand how specific organisations and individual designers innovate, adapt and respond to multiple constraints. Through the implementation of iterative design processes such as the interaction design lifecycle model, you will learn to evaluate the feasibility of projects and adapt project goals. Your work will culminate in a series of working prototypes that have been incrementally improved through repeated user testing and the iterative design process.
