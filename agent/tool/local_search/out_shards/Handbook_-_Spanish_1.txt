Spanish is the language of over four hundred million people. It is spoken officially in 23 countries, and it is the second language of the United States, where there are some 45 million Spanish speakers. Spanish is also one of the four major languages of the European Union alongside English, French, and German. If you are interested in learning one of the most commonly spoken first languages in the world and have no prior knowledge of the Spanish language, then this is the right course for you. Based on a communicative and culture-based approach, this course is designed to help you quickly develop your proficiency in basic oral and written Spanish. Vocabulary and basic Spanish grammar are presented in contexts that are relevant for everyday language use. You will also learn basic language learning strategies to make your learning process more effective.
We are the first and only university in Australia using the innovative Online Language exchange program TERTULIA, which offers you a unique opportunity to work outside of class with a native-speaker student located in a Spanish Speaking country in a real-time, online learning environment. We hope that this unique personal experience will be truly enjoyable and will motivate you to continue learning Spanish.
This course is a beginners-level language course. All students who have had some experience with the language, either as a heritage language or through previous instruction, must fill in the placement questionnaire available at
https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/hal/study-us/resources-support/language-placements
. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
