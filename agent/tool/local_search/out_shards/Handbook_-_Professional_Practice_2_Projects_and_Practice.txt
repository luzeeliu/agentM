Professional Practice 2: Projects and Practice introduces you to the professional expectations and requirements of the practicing architect with a focus on the realisation of architectural projects. You will examine the practice of architecture through topics addressing the core responsibilities and activities of the architect. This includes client and stakeholder engagement and management, project types, procurement methods, documentation and approval processes, and regulatory, legal, ethical, contractual and business responsibilities.
The course content and activities encourage the development of professional behaviours, particularly around communications, writing and technical language, strategic thinking, and how best to consider sustainability and societal concerns. Aspects of practice are presented and discussed in relation to the design, documentation and delivery of architectural projects: from client architect agreements and fee proposals through to briefing, documentation and approval processes, tendering, the establishment of building contracts and contract administration. Procurement and contracting methods are explored alongside an understanding of key professional relationships such as those with specialty consultants, external and internal stakeholders, and contractors.
