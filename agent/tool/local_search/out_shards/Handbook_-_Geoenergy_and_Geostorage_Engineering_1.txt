Engineering Science equips graduates to apply a combination of knowledge and skills to engineering tasks and systems. It provides both foundational knowledge in the underpinnings of Engineering, discipline specific understanding, and practice in the application of that to complex situations.
The major allows for a flexible choice of courses in the field of Geoenergy and Geostorage Engineering, and develops abilities in problem solving, communication and team work. Students are prepared to implement and improve geoenergy and geostorage technology in a range of environments, from industry, to research, to commercial enterprise.

Course Substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superseded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
