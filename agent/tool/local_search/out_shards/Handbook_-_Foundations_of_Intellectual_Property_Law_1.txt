This course surveys the fundamentals of Australian intellectual property law. It introduces students to the law of copyright (including moral rights), registered designs, trade marks, passing off, consumer law prohibiting misleading and deceptive conduct, breach of confidence, and patents. Students study the fundamental statutory provisions and common law principles that define the subject matter protected by these intellectual property doctrines, as well as the pre-conditions for protection and the nature of infringement. They learn how to approach intellectual property problems in practice, and gain insight into the interrelationships between intellectual property’s various doctrines.
The course provides students with a good working knowledge of the fundamental principles of intellectual property law. It aims to build solid foundations for lawyers who may or may not want to specialise in intellectual property, as well as those who might later undertake further studies to specialise in this area of law.
This course is a pre-requisite for LAWS3057/JURD7357 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice, which is recommended for students who seek to further their knowledge of intellectual property policy issues and/or to deepen their skills applying intellectual property law in practice.
