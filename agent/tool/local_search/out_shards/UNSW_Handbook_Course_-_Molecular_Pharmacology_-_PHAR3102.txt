Description
Molecular Pharmacology will examine the molecular basis of drug action.  It will explore how cutting edge biotechnology and biomedical research can advance pharmacological knowledge, increasing our understanding of how drugs work.  The following areas will be studied in detail; genetic variability in drug action, protein structure-activity relationships, receptor-ligand interactions, signal transduction, biochemical and molecular aspects of G-proteins and phosphorylation mechanisms. Research and analytical skills will be developed in practical classes.
