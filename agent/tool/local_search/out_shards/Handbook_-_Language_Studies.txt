The Diploma in Language Studies is designed to provide students with the opportunity to acquire proficiency in a second language or, for those looking for a broader language-learning focus, the opportunity to study up to two language areas.
You can choose from six languages offered by the School of Humanities and Languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, German, and Spanish. You will develop and strengthen your key language skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Alongside improving your language proficiency, you will also have the opportunity to enhance your understanding of the societies and cultures in which your language is spoken. Developing your language competence and cultural understanding will enable you to work effectively in areas of cross-cultural communication. UNSW’s diploma also offers you a flexible pathway for further language studies. You can choose either to take it concurrently with another degree program or after the completion of your academic degree.
For those wanting a broader language focus, you may complete the Language Studies major and take up to two language areas with the option to complete contextual language studies in any area.
