This is an advanced course within the Master of Psychology (Clinical) program comprising a workshop series that explores complex clinical issues, including working with severe client presentations and specific client populations. Candidates will be encouraged to take an evidence-based approach, linking research evidence, clinical judgment and diversity factors. This course introduces the theory and practice of more severe psychological conditions, including defining features and characteristics; diagnostic and assessment issues; evidence-based intervention strategies; and procedures for evaluating outcome of interventions. This course emphasises the importance of individual and cultural diversity factors in the practice of clinical psychology when working with clients from diverse backgrounds. The course also focuses on developing the understanding of candidates in inter-professional learning and practice, including consultation and collaboration with other professionals particularly in the context of complex client presentations.
