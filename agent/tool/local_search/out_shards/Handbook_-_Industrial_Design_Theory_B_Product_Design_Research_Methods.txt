Industrial Design Theory B introduces you to a range of established industrial design research methods, theories, and approaches to understand existing products and develop new ones. The course focuses on rigorous academic research skills and writing within the context of industrial design research, including activities such as observation, analysis and interpretation of user behaviours, simulation of design alternatives, and analysis of available information.
