DPBS1100 is the first course in the Diploma of Business and provides students with a rigorous introduction to business decision-making. Taking the perspective of a manager, students learn about economic, corporate responsibility and legal principles to understand what organisational leaders need to consider and what actions they might take when making business decisions.
Fundamental economic principles inform managers to ask and answer questions about how the economy works, and how these principles influence the decisions that individuals and organisations make. Core legal principles guide managers to protect value for owners and other stakeholders, and to protect both managers and organisations from public and private legal actions arising from their decisions. Corporate sustainability principles direct managers to meet the organisation’s responsibilities to a range of stakeholders and help explain why organisations may not always make the best decisions.
Link to other courses: DPBS1100 is a prerequisite for Global Business Environments (DPBS1150). An understanding of business decision-making is also beneficial to learn about value creation (DPBS1180), how organisational resources are managed (DPBS1170), and business-related problem solving more broadly (DPBS1110).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
