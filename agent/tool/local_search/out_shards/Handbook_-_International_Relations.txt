Studying International Relations (IR) at UNSW will equip you with a strong theoretical and practical understanding of contemporary world politics. The program is designed to introduce you to the main theories and theoretical traditions developed to explain the practices and processes of world politics. You will explore the main theories that have been developed to explain such politics, examining how particular theories organise and shape our view of, and ability to act in the world. These theoretical insights provide the tools to explain various influences on the behaviour of states and other international actors.
The Master of International Relations (MIR) will extend and deepen your existing skills, knowledge and understanding of world politics as well as teaching advanced skills in research and analytical thinking. The program offers the opportunity to analyse issues such as the conduct of war and the pursuit of international peace and security, the global economy and environment, international law and diplomacy, international and regional institutions, and human rights. In practical terms, you will study current issues of international concern, including regional conflicts and global great power rivalry, economic uncertainty, environmental threats, humanitarian crises, human rights violations, global poverty and terrorism.
