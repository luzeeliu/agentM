The Housing Management and Markets course will enable students to gain an understanding of the rental housing and strata management industry. As regards 'housing management' the course will concentrate on 'managed housing'; that is the 'professionally administered' part of the housing market. This will entail a focus on multi-occupied residential buildings (the strata sector), on market rental dwellings under professional real estate management, and on affordable rental housing run by social landlords (primarily state governments and not-for-profit community housing providers). The husbandry of owner occupied housing and mum-and-dad-investor-managed market rental housing will therefore be largely outwith the course remit. Students will learn about 'housing management industry' structure, about rental and strata property law, about the property and tenancy management practice, and about rental property investment practice. They will also become familiar with analytical methods applicable to property investment and market performance. Framing themes running through the course will include business practices and technological developments impacting on the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management practice, as well as on the housing system more broadly. While the coverage will focus primarily on Australian policy frameworks and industry practices, where possible these will be considered within an international comparative context.
