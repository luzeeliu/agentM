This course builds on an elementary knowledge of chemistry (equivalent to two years of high school chemistry, such as Year 12 chemistry, or CHEM1001 at UNSW) to explore the quantum mechanical structure of atoms leading to an understanding of the periodic trends in the properties of the elements. This knowledge is applied to understanding chemical bonding and intermolecular forces which together are responsible for determining the properties of materials. General principles of chemical equilibrium are developed and applied to chemical reactions involving acids and bases. The applications of the laws of Thermodynamics to chemical processes are described and ultimately linked to chemical equilibrium. The course involves an overview of chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including their applications in biology, corrosion and energy storage for portable electronic devices.
The theoretical content of the course is delivered through a combination of online lessons, workshops and lectures with problem solving skills developed in weekly group-based tutorial classes. Theory is combined with the practical aspects of chemistry in weekly laboratory classes.
This course covers the same material as CHEM1011, but has differentiated laboratory and tutorial classes to allow for more indepth exploration of the material in small group contexts.
Note
:
Assumed knowledge equivalent to year 12 chemistry or CHEM1001.
Students cannot subsequently enrol in CHEM1001 after completing CHEM1031. However, students may complete CHEM1001 followed by CHEM1031.
