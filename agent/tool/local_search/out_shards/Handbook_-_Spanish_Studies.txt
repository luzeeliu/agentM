This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The minor specialisation in Spanish Studies enables you to study Spanish at a number of levels in order to attain proficiency. Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced levels. You will not only develop your knowledge of the Spanish language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies, history, film and literature in the Spanish-speaking world. The Spanish language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Spanish Studies will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in Spanish will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.

Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.
You are responsible for ensuring that you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and by following the advice of your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program requirements.
Additional Information
Students in the intermediate sequence who will complete some components of their sequence via cross-institutional study are advised that they are responsible for enrolling themselves before the appropriate UNSW and partner university deadlines for cross-institutional enrolment, which fall well before the beginning of regular UNSW teaching periods. See
Cross Institutional Study
.
Each course of cross-institutional study requires approval from the Spanish Studies convenor, with whom students must consult at an early stage to discuss the selection of courses. Students who successfully complete Spanish Studies courses cross-institutionally will have their results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, i.e. specific grades will not appear on their transcript.
If in a given term you are unable to take appropriate courses cross-institutionally you may be eligible to apply for an individual variation of program.
Placement Information
If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found at:
School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements
.
You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2570 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.
