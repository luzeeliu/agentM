In this course you will examine how climate change intersects with lawyering across public, private and community legal practice. It is increasingly recognised that all lawyers must take a climate conscious approach to their legal practice. Lawyers need to understand how climate change and its consequences are creating injustices, and altering responsibilities of business enterprises, financial institutions, governments, and society.
Drawing on the expertise of multiple teachers from across the Faculty, classes will cover a broad range of climate-related aspects of domestic and international law, and legal policy and justice issues connected to climate change. Topics may include:
just transitions
energy transitions
climate impacts on lower socio-economic populations, elderly people and people living with disability
Indigenous lands, communities, science and research
ecocide, climate apartheid and victimisation of advocates
responding to climate risks
climate mobility/displacement
sea-level rise and ocean acidification
loss and damage and adaptation
mitigating climate impacts
carbon taxes and dividends
urban sustainability, planning and new economies
water, agricultural, ecosystems and their nexus with climate change
legal innovations
duties of care
director’s duties, financial disclosures and institutional investors
climate litigation and human rights, children, and future generations
open research and sharing sustainable innovation
You will reflect on new and developing career pathways for climate conscious lawyers, and contrast the opportunities and challenges of incremental versus systemic legal changes in response to climate change.
