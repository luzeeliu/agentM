Legal Research and Writing provides students with an introduction to key legal skills necessary for successful study and practice of the law. This course introduces foundational legal writing and research skills, such as legal citation, location of primary and secondary materials and various forms of legal writing, including case notes and answering problem questions.
All students enrolled in Legal Research and Writing will also enrol in the co-requisite course, LAWS1052 Introducing Law and Justice, which introduces students to the history, operation and contemporary dynamics of the Australian legal system, to the relationships between law and justice and to the core legal skills necessary for successful study and practice.
Students will attend classes for Introducing Law and Justice as well as classes for Legal Research and Writing.
The skills and knowledge taught in Legal Research and Writing are foundational to the skills and knowledge covered and assessed in Introducing Law and Justice and later courses.
