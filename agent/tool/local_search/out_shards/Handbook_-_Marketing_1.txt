Marketing is a dynamic management discipline concerned with exchange processes in competitive markets. It is of critical importance in all sectors of the economy, including local and international businesses, and profit-making and non-profit making organisations.
The business function of marketing seeks to identify the needs and wants of customers, determine potential target markets, design appropriate products and services, communicate this offering to customers and distribute it to the marketplace. A wider goal of marketing is to create an organisation-wide ethos that is responsive to customer needs, aware of competitive forces, and builds on core strengths of the organisation.
Graduates find careers in product management, customer services, new product planning, international marketing, logistics and distribution, sales and purchasing, advertising, direct marketing and public relations, marketing research, management consultancy and e-business. General management training programs are also a popular option. Graduates find their skills are in heavy demand across both public and private sectors, nationally and internationally. There are affiliations with professional organisations such as the Advertising Federation of Australia, the Australian Marketing Institute, The Radio Marketing Bureau, and the Australian Customer Service Association.
A major in Marketing consists of 48 UOC (8 courses). Six (6) of these courses are specified; the other two (2) are electives that are chosen from a specified list. This is regardless of whether you are doing a single major or taking marketing as a second major
A minor in Marketing consists of 30 UOC (5 courses) including MARK2012 and 24UOC (4 courses) with a MARK course code from the “Marketing Major (MARKA1) Electives” list with at least 6UOC at Level 3. The minor does not form part of the nominated major.
