Students attend the Faculty's in house clinic, Kingsford Legal Centre, one full day a week. The Centre is a community legal centre which provides a free legal service to the local community. Students manage client files under the supervision of experienced clinical supervisors who are practising solicitors. Students are responsible for interviewing clients and the research, drafting and preparation necessary to resolve legal difficulties by litigation or other means. In addition to one day attendance, students attend evening advice sessions during which they interview clients needing  legal advice, in conjunction with volunteer lawyers. A daily tutorial and a weekly class provide an opportunity for discussion and analysis of students' experiences, and for instruction in legal procedure and skills. There are regular opportunities to attend Court and Tribunals. Major areas of work in which students will be involved include domestic violence, discrimination, consumer credit, victims compensation, family law, employment law, wills, legal aid and criminal justice issues. As well as client files, students take part in community education, and in policy and law reform work. The course teaches students about how law and the legal system function through working with real clients. This enables students to analyse the effect of law in practice and engenders in students an appreciation of the ethical, social and practical complexity of the legal system.
