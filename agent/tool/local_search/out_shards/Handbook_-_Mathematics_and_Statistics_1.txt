Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
The entry requirement for the Graduate Diploma in Mathematics and Statistics is one of the following:
A recognised bachelor degree (or equivalent qualification) with a major in a cognate discipline area and an overall average of 65 or higher, as determined by the UNSW Postgraduate Coursework Entry Calculator; OR
An average of 65 or higher in at least 4 courses in mathematics or statistics at the second-year undergraduate level or above, as determined by the UNSW Postgraduate Coursework Entry Calculator.
International students:
Prospective international students need to meet the
University's English language requirements
.
Assumed knowledge:
A mathematical background of a minimum of one course in several variable calculus and one course in linear algebra at the university undergraduate level. (Applies to both admission pathways).
Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is the transfer of credit towards a program from another degree. The following policy applies to students with degrees from other institutions and students with an undergraduate degree from UNSW.
In limited cases, students with previous postgraduate or honours-level coursework, including Honours graduates from UNSW, may receive advanced standing/recognition of prior learning. Advanced standing is limited to a maximum of 12 UoC.
Advanced standing will only be granted for courses at the honours or postgraduate level, not courses at the undergraduate level. Students must apply for advanced standing and the School of Mathematics and Statistics will determine if the student’s completed coursework is deemed equivalent to UNSW counterparts.  Advanced standing is not guaranteed.

Program Requirements
Progression Requirements
Students may request to transfer into a Master's program after completing
at least 24 UoC
of the Graduate Diploma (5659).
Students who have
completed
at least
24 UoC
and have a WAM of 65 may apply to transfer into the Master of Mathematics (8719), Master of Statistics (8750), or Master of Financial Mathematics (8161).
Students aiming to transfer into a Masters degree program should plan their coursework to ensure the courses they take as part of the Graduate Diploma count for their intended Masters degree.
Not all courses
taken as part of the Graduate Diploma count toward all the degrees listed above. For example, MATH5846, MATH5856, and MATH5901 do not count for the Master of Statistics (8750) or Master of Financial Mathematics (8161).
