In this laboratory-based course, you will experiment with the properties and functions of dairy, meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, beverages, eggs, sugars, cereals, and lipids as food ingredients. You will demonstrate the need for preservation through physical, chemical and biological deterioration factors, and water relationships. You will also experiment with food processing technologies to explore steps including heating, chilling, freezing, drying, brining, pickling, sugar, packaging (modified atmosphere and controlled atmosphere), chemical preservatives, and novel methods.
Your laboratory work is extended with structured inspections (site visits) of a variety of food processing establishments such as food companies, production areas, and food research institutes. You will learn about the structure, practical operation, and management of the local food industry, and see how your knowledge of food science and technology is applied in commercial situations.
