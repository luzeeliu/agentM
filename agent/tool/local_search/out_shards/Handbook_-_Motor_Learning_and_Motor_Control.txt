In this course, you will develop a broad understanding of how we coordinate, control and learn voluntary movement. This course explores the underlying neurophysiology of motor control and the concepts and processes that underpin controlled movement, motor learning and fatigue that are relevant to the role of an exercise and physiotherapy practitioner. You will gain a greater understanding of the structure of the nervous system and how it affects motor control. In addition, you will gain a better understanding of how motor performance and motor learning can be measured and of the associated theories and concepts that underpin the control of voluntary movement such as attention, memory and sensory integration. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and capability to assess motor skill proficiency and design training and development programs that optimise the quality of skill acquisition in a range of exercise contexts.
