Large-scale exhibitions, art fairs, biennales, and festivals are increasingly important to the contemporary art ecosystem. While complementing the traditional functions of galleries and museums, these major cultural events also offer new models for engaging audiences with art. This course provides an opportunity to learn in the context of a major exhibition, art fair, biennale, or festival, in a local setting. Through structured coursework and ‘on the ground’ experiences, you will develop theoretical and practical understandings of the ways that contemporary art production, presentation, and reception are shaped by major exhibitions and events. The course uses intensive delivery modes including an initial period of preparatory work and then a period of direct engagement with a specific large-scale exhibition or cultural event.
