NOTE:
This course was previously identified as MBAX9143.
This course aims to equip you with the skills, knowledge and experience to formulate, evaluate and implement value-creating strategies for organisations. The course introduces you to the contemporary principles, tools and frameworks of strategic management that support the work of successful strategists in leading sustainable organisations.
