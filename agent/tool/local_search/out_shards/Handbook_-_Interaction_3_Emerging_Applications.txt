This advanced course within the Interaction disciplinary studio will introduce you to some of the state-of-the-art emerging applications in interaction design. Throughout the course, you will examine the importance of human physical, social and cognitive abilities to inform the design process. The course focuses on the key emerging technological areas that are transforming current interaction design practice, including artificial intelligence, conversational interfaces, robotic interfaces, and mixed reality environments.
In this course, you will undertake an in-depth project that focuses on one of the identified key emerging technological areas. Your main task is to work through the interaction design process, by building on the concepts, methodologies and technical skills developed in Interaction 1 and 2, to derive design prototypes for a designated theme. In particular, your project will demonstrate an emphasis on relevant human capabilities and their successful integration into your design prototypes.
