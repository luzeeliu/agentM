This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Linguistics is the study of human language. The minor specialisation in Linguistics provides you the opportunity to develop an understanding of a variety of questions such as: How do people use language in various situations? What is the biological basis for language? Is language unique to the human species? How and why do languages change? How do children learn language? What is the meaning of 'meaning'? Can machines talk? How does language relate to other modes of communication? Linguistics also provides the basis for a variety of practical applications including, at UNSW, the teaching and learning of foreign languages, translating and interpreting, facilitating cross-cultural communication, developing language curricula in schools, and improving literacy skills.
