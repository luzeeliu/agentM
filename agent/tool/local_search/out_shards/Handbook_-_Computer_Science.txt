Computer Science involves the study of the design, construction and uses of computer systems. It is concerned with the representation of data and data structures in computer systems and the design of algorithms for automatic manipulation of this information by programming languages and machine systems. It is very much concerned with the design and development of hardware and software tools by which computer applications may be developed, but not so much with the applications themselves. It is, however, noted that non-computing elements (such as human interface or psychological aspects) can often dictate the level of success of computing systems. At UNSW, particular emphasis is given to comprehension of the basic principles behind computing tools, operating systems, compilers and translators, and computer hardware.
