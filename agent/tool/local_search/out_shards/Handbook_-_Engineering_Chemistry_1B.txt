Overview
This course further develops the introduction to the engineering aspects of chemistry started in CHEM1811. The course explores organic and inorganic chemistry through the investigation of topics such as kinetics, control of reactions, structure determination, stereochemistry, main group chemistry, transition metal chemistry, and the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds.

This course further develops the introduction to the engineering aspects of chemistry started in CHEM1811. The course explores organic and inorganic chemistry through the investigation of topics such as kinetics, control of reactions, structure determination, stereochemistry, main group chemistry, transition metal chemistry, and the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds.
The target audience for this course is students who need a strong chemistry basis that will be applied in areas such as engineering and there will be an emphasis on the engineering applications of chemistry in the petrochemical industry, environmental chemistry, and renewable energies.
The theoretical content of the course is delivered through a combination of online lessons, workshops and lectures with problem solving skills developed in weekly group-based tutorial classes. Theory is combined with the practical aspects of chemistry in weekly laboratory classes. There is typically 8 contact hours per week (or 9 for weeks containing and in-term test) plus a guide that you should spend an hour of independent study for each contact hour.
The syllabus is divided into “threshold” and “mastery” topics (50:50). The “threshold” topics will be continuously assessed throughout semester and the mastery content primarily assessed in the final exam.
