Electrical Engineering Modelling and Simulation surveys the basic techniques required for computer modelling of a range of electrical engineering systems. The course covers the modelling of differential equations and difference equations, finite difference approximation, transfer functions and state-space realisations, presented from a practical perspective. The course will emphasise both analytical and implementation skills, covering an introduction to simulation programming techniques, mainly in MATLAB but also including some basic C programming. Example application areas will include modelling of linear second-order circuits, non-linear circuits, electrical machines and power systems, control systems, biomedical systems, and introductory network simulation. A simulation project will allow development of individual interests within this area.
