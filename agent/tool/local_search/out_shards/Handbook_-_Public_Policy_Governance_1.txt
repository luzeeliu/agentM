The Public Policy and Governance Professional Doctorate (PrDoc) is an applied research professional degree that is designed specifically for policy professionals, policy officers and policy analysts engaged in policy leadership, advocacy and practice. The Public Policy and Governance (PrDoc) aims to develop the policy leadership, expertise and research of policy professionals engaging in real world policy problems occurring within their professional practice.
The Public Policy and Governance (PrDoc) is a postgraduate research degree available for policy professionals working in the government, non-government and private sectors such as policy think tanks, policy advocacy and policy governance institutions. It provides the opportunity to combine postgraduate coursework study directly related to advanced policy work with doctoral research that builds applied knowledge on policy and governance processes.
In this program, mastery of the professional body of knowledge is achieved in the coursework component, which builds on prior education and the experience gained through professional practice. Based on this mastery of the professional body of knowledge, the thesis component of the program develops the research skills necessary for an experienced practitioner to be able to make a significant contribution to the continuous improvement of their discipline’s professional practice. See
UNSW Higher Degree Research Learning Outcomes
.

The Public Policy and Governance (PrDoc) is designed as a three year full-time equivalent program, structured as one-third coursework (equivalent to one year full-time, Year 1) and two-thirds research (equivalent to two years full-time, Years 2 and 3).
