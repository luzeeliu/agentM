The thesis is an inquiry-based learning course that provides students with an opportunity to bring together and apply engineering principles learned over their previous years of study and professional experience to innovatively solve problems such as the development of a specific design, process and/or the investigation of a hypothesis.
The thesis projects that students undertake are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for their creativity, and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. There are multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset that have sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning from the students. The thesis requires students to formulate problems in scientific or engineering terms, manage a technical project and find solutions by applying scientific and engineering methods. It also allows them to develop the ability to work in a research and development environment.
This is the third course in the three-course thesis structure. Subject to making excellent progress in ELEC4951 and with the approval of your supervisor and Director of Academic Studies, you may be allowed to enrol in this course at the same time as ELEC4952.
