Engaging Audiences introduces you to the core of persuasive communications: the ability to reach a deep understanding of the people you are communicating with. The successful brands of tomorrow won’t preach to their audience, they will immerse themselves in their consumers’ worlds so they can engage on their level. This means listening, thinking critically, and asking the right questions. Who are they? Where are they? What do they desire? What keeps them awake at night? How do they make sense of the world? These questions are the building blocks for crafting the insightful campaigns that transform a clients' problem into a strategic and creative public relations or advertising solution. To answer them you need the right tools to understand and analyse consumers, publics, and media audiences. So, wherever your communications journey ends up taking you—engaging consumers in tomorrow’s brand communities or energising the public in policy decisions that will change the future—this is where success on that journey begins.
