Why is music so enjoyable, and is it really good for us? This course addresses a range of questions concerned with the pleasure and health aspects of music. Other questions discussed include: Is it possible to hate music? Is it good for your brain? Why can music be used to treat some illnesses and reduce anxiety? Can it be bad for you? A range of approaches are considered, from mass media and personal perspectives, through to philosophical inquiry, aesthetics and psychology. The course aims to challenge and furnish you with skills in critically evaluating various views on how music preference and wellbeing programs emerge, and presents recent thinking on the topics. Tutorials focus on designing and evaluating practical applications of music in health and entertainment settings.
