Renewable Energy has become a real alternative to electricity generation based on fossil fuels due to their superior sustainability credentials and the low cost achieved during the last decade, thanks to heavy investment in research, development, and large-scale manufacturing. As such, renewable energy systems like solar and wind are expected to become the leading generation sources in the next few decades and provide most of the energy needs for our society. These renewable energy systems must be integrated into the electrical network so the energy can be used safely and efficiently where and when it is needed most.
This course will teach the principles of power engineering, emphasizing renewable energy systems, including single and 3-phase AC circuit calculations, principles of transformers and power electronic converters, principles of solar and wind energy conversion systems, and an introduction to AC transmission and distribution infrastructure.
