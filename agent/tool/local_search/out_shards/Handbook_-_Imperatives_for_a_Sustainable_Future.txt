Imperatives for a Sustainable Future provides you with a critical understanding of the theoretical and practical implications of design as a professional activity. It presents design’s impacts on society, economics and the environment. It aims to develop an understanding of how to deal with wicked problems, colonial legacies and human waste issues, by using a design-thinking sustainability framework informed by ethics, systems thinking, Indigenous knowledge and non-human worlds. You will use foresight tools for developing sustainable strategies as well as methods for measuring and monitoring successful design conception and implementation. Key themes will include the four pillars of sustainability applied to products, services and systems; aesthetics of care; non-human models; the Anthropocene; responsibility in leadership; and cross disciplinary collaboration.
