Good communication skills are foundational to learning and future employment across STEMM - for example, aviation, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, medicine, public health and other disciplines. Students must be able to craft their messages into different shapes for different audiences, whether they are writing a lecture, report, research paper, or presenting to peers or public audiences.
This course combines theoretical and practical learning. It begins with understanding how the brain processes communication and that people, not things, are at the centre of effective messaging. Self-paced weekly lessons are designed for foundational knowledge and include activities for students to reflect on their understanding of key concepts. Weekly mandatory live online interactive workshops underpin the week's lesson, encourage students to engage in higher-order thinking and interact with their peers. There is no final exam.
Three skills-oriented assessments provide the key dimensions of effective communication. These include critical and reflective thinking skills, active listening and reading skills, storytelling as the most effective form of communication, slide creation and presentation skills, writing coherently, cohesively, clearly, concisely and engagingly, and adapting communication to the needs of multiple audiences. Students also learn how to research topics, write a research question, and search for and evaluate primary and secondary sources of information in a post-truth world.
