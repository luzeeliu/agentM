Overview
The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Science (3733) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Science (3767) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree. The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides… For more content click the Read More button below.
The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Science (3733) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Science (3767) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.
The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.
The Bachelor of Science allows you to study a wide range of science subjects as well as many other areas of interest. This degree is ideal for students who seek a 'generalist' degree in which there is a large element of choice. Students are encouraged to choose a broad range of courses in the first year, to expand their general understanding of Science which then enables them to choose from a wide selection of major options in the second and third year. The rules and requirements for the degree are set out below.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Engineering Science (96 UOC)
A 96 UOC Engineering Science major
Bachelor of Science (96 UOC)
Core Courses
An approved Bachelor of Science Major
Science Elective Courses
Employability Experience Courses
In this dual degree students take 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering Science, and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Science, for a total of 192 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering Science major and Science major there may be overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 192 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.
Course Substitutions
Depending on the combination of Engineering Science major and Science major, you may need to take a specific Science course in place of the listed Engineering Science course (e.g. a more advanced Maths course). Please refer to the Engineering (Hons)/Science handbook page for a list of common substitutions.

The Engineering Science specialisation component requires completion of 96 UOC of Engineering courses, chosen from those listed in the relevant BE (Hons) discipline specialisation.
At least 24 UOC of these courses must be from Level 3 or above.
Course substitution

A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
