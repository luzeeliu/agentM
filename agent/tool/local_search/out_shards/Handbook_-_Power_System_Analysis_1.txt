Power system analysis serves as the fundamental pillar of power engineering, playing a vital role in career development within this field. ELEC4612 aims to provide a robust understanding of power system analysis, delivering necessary knowledge and skills to overcome the dynamic challenges present in the power industry.
The course commences with an in-depth overview of modern power systems, emphasising the fundamental concepts employed in power system analysis. These include phasors, complex power, three-phase systems, and per-unit methodology. The subsequent phase of the course delves into the process of modelling transformers, generators, transmission lines, and loads. This hands-on exploration culminates in the construction of network matrices, providing a comprehensive understanding of the interconnections within power systems. It then explores the ways and means to perform power flow analysis under steady-state conditions, fault analysis under symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults, and stability analysis using swing equation and equal area criterion. It further provides mastery over the intricacies involved in achieving a balanced electric grid, through an exploration of power system control and economic dispatch.
