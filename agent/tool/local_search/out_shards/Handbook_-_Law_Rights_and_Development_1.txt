Development is vital to the livelihoods of billions of people. This course explores the interactions between international human rights law, other bodies of international law and the process or phenomenon of development. It does this by exploring the legal and normative framework within which international law involves itself in rights and development and by identifying several aspects for closer examination. Particular attention is given to: theories of rights and development; the role of ‘political’ laws in development; the gender dimensions of development, community participation in development projects, development aid, the rule of law, the impact of international economic law on rights and development and transnational business.
This course will focus on international law and development and will explore these ideas from the viewpoint of law’s bright and dark sides. Law, Rights and Development is one of the elective subjects for law and will normally be taken after completion of a more general international law course.
Main Topics (which may vary)
Particular attention is given to some or all of the following topics:
Theories of Law and Development
The Right to Development
Community Participation
The Bretton Woods Institutions and Development
Labour and Development
Development Aid
The Rule of Law
