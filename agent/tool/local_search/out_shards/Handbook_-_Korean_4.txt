This course provides upper-intermediate tuition in Korean language study through a communicative and task-based approach. It builds on prior learning to strengthen fluency, accuracy, and confidence across the four core skills. The course introduces complex grammar structures in context, including expressions of obligation, reported speech, hypotheses, comparisons, and regrets. Students learn to engage in discussions about real-world topics such as health, memory and dreams, weather and natural disasters, media, money matters, and life challenges. They also develop strategies for understanding and producing a range of spoken and written texts, including personal reflections, reports, and opinion-based writing. The course continues to explore key aspects of Korean society and culture, while fostering independent learning through flexible engagement tasks and multimodal resources. While not an official TOPIK preparation course, Korean 4 introduces higher-level language features that support further study toward TOPIK II and advanced Korean proficiency.
