Future Leader Lab is a leadership development course in which students develop leadership skills through learning how to use technology, innovation and entrepreneurship to address the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a particular focus on SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities.  Students will work in interdisciplinary teams (though are assessed individually) to consider how community, government, and industry leadership can solve challenging, real-world problems. In this course, students will learn about theories and applications of leadership and engage with and learn from different experts.
The course aims to address today’s challenges in making our cities and communities sustainable through developing and applying innovation and entrepreneurship to new knowledge in circular economies, clean energy, and renewable transport. A fourth learning theme is digital literacy and the role of technology in supporting innovative and entrepreneurial solution solutions. Students will have the opportunity to learn about personal and organisational leadership and how they might lead change in the future.
CDEV3500 can be taken as a General Elective, and is an approved FYS course for BCom students.
