Typically, vibration is undesirable. It can lead to excessive deflections and the failure of machines and structures. But vibration can also be useful. We can use vibration content as an indicator of a machine’s condition or to diagnosis its faults.  This course will help you to understand, measure, make accurate predictions, and communicate about the world around you through the lens of vibration analysis. Almost every machine and structure you will ever encounter produces vibration. By the end of this course, you will be able to measure and predict the vibratory response of real-world engineering systems and use this information to control or harness the power of vibration.
This course builds upon the acquired knowledge of an introductory course in vibrations (such as MMAN2300) where you will have studied oscillatory systems under a number of simplifying assumptions – sinusoidal forcing, constant coefficients, simple boundary conditions, etc. In this course, you will examine more complex systems and excitations. As such, you will be exposed to new techniques for modelling, measuring and analysing oscillatory systems. The analytical and computational tools you will develop in this course will be applied to the challenging and critical application of machine condition monitoring. Vibration-based condition monitoring is a large and expanding field of engineering research and application, which allows massive safety improvements and economic advantages in almost every industry.
