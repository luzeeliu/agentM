The biomedical engineering masters project allows coursework masters students to experience research training either within the school or with collaborating institutions such as hospitals and CSIRO. These projects offer a distinctive chance for you to merge the engineering principles you've acquired throughout your prior years of study, and apply these principles to address unresolved engineering challenges in the realm of human health. Projects are selected by the student in consultation with a supervisor conducting research in an area of interest to the student. If the research topic selected is external to the School/University, the student must arrange for an internal GSBmE co-supervisor/assessor.
BIOM9021 is the second half of the 12 UOC research project. BIOM9020 is the first half. Enrolment in these courses allows a student to undertake the equivalent of BIOM9914 Masters Project over two terms. Projects are assessed on the basis of a scientific manuscript (70%) in the format of a research paper ready for submission to a refereed journal or conference proceeding. A poster presentation (10%) is also required. The final grade of the thesis will be the weighted average of your assessments from BIOM9020 (20%) and BIOM9021 (70% for manuscript +10% for poster presentation). You will receive the same grade for both courses upon completion of BIOM9021.
