In this course, you’ll undertake industry-engaged learning by interning with a relevant host while also earning credit towards your degree. Internships are a great way to gain work experience while you’re studying. They can help improve your employability, develop your job-seeking skills, clarify where you’d like to work after you graduate, generate material for your portfolio, increase your professional confidence, and build strategic professional networks.
SAM internships require 100 hours of work with a host organisation and can be taken in first, second or third term. You can either apply for a Faculty-sourced position with one of our partner organisations or independently find your own internship. Remote and hybrid internships are also available. Contact the Faculty’s Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) unit (
ada-wil@unsw.edu.au
) for more information about which option is right for you. The WIL unit can also help you enrol in MDIA5100 so you are able to gain access to the course Moodle site. At the end of your placement, you’ll need to submit a critical reflection on your experiences and a collection of work examples completed during your internship. This is a simple pass/fail course with no formal teaching components.
Before seeking an internship, we strongly recommend contacting UNSW Careers (
https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/careers
) and UNSW Employability (
https://www.careers.unsw.edu.au
) for help assembling your CV, cover letter, and other components of your application.
No minimum WAM is required.
For all further inquiries, please contact the Faculty’s Work-Integrated Learning unit by emailing
