While politics has always been mediated and race and racism has played a role in political, social, and cultural formations for a long time, developments in digital technology have accelerated the racialisation of diverse aspects of contemporary life, both public and private. Now, even the critical study of race has been weaponised. In this course, you will learn how social media plays a crucial role in anti-racist protest movements, how global media representation figures on and off screens, how digital technologies are being mobilised by First Nations communities, how mediated multiculturalism can become apolitical, and how formal politics uses media to engage with racially minoritized communities. Using case studies such as the Black Lives Matter movement, the rise and consequences of online extremism and mis/disinformation, ‘diverse’ series commissioned by streaming platforms, and Indigenous X, you will explore topic such as the ongoing debates within race scholarship, ‘race’ as a floating signifier, algorithms and race, racism and national identity, settler colonialism, intersectionality, Whiteness, and racial capitalism. By the end of the course, you will have a clear grasp of the interconnections between media technologies, race/racism and politics, and the critical and conceptual tools to make your own interventions in media practice.
