Hydrogen is considered to be a key enabler in decarbonisation of our fossil fuel dependent energy system. Of course, here are challenges to developing a global hydrogen economy including technological, economic, social license, safety issues and regulatory barriers.
In this 6 unit of credit course, you will learn about current and disruptive hydrogen technologies, associated safety protocols, cradle-to-cradle systems, and its economics. Complemented by industry guest lectures on real world hydrogen application and case studies, you will learn to design hydrogen systems, establish frameworks for economic and environmental assessments and apply safety protocols for the emerging hydrogen economy. The course is taught in blended mode with all staff-student and student-student interactions occurring through a combination of technology-enabled and face-to-face teaching and learning activities.
By the end of the course, you will be equipped with skills and understanding required for Australia’s next biggest job market.
