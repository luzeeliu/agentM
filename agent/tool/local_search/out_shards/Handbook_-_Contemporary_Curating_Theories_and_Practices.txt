Contemporary curating is a dynamic profession that responds to and initiates cultural change. It is a practice that is continually being re-examined and reinvented. At the same time it has a long and rich history that intersects with the histories of art production, material culture, aesthetic experience, collection, display and the institutions of museums and galleries.
This course investigates contemporary curatorial practices and the theories that inform them. It examines current debates in light of the historical evolution of the profession, including issues such as globalization, technological change, shifting notions of the public, spatial politics, new theories of objecthood, reconsiderations of art institutions, alternative views of time and history and interdisciplinary collaborations.
The course pays special attention to experimental and innovative forms of curating and the particular kinds of new knowledge produced through curatorial practice. Through a close examination of the work of a diverse range of curators it builds an understanding of the individuality of curatorial practice as well as the shared languages, concerns and skills that define the field.
The course is delivered in collaboration with Galleries UNSW and other industry partners to offer guest lectures and seminars by outstanding Australian and international curators.
