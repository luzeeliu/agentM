The major in Statistics has been designed to ensure that graduates are well trained in three key areas: probability and stochastic processes, statistical inference and modelling, and modern statistical computing methods. Third year electives allow students to further develop their statistical capabilities according to their own interests. Computing has become firmly entrenched in modern Statistics and our courses take full advantage of our excellent computing facilities. This will only enhance the portfolio of skills that students bring to their career.

Additional Information
Notes
Many courses in Mathematics are offered at two levels. The higher level courses cater for students with greater mathematical ability and/or a higher level of prior knowledge. Students with suitable qualifications are encouraged to enrol in the higher level courses.
Students who are completing the Bachelor Science (majoring in Statistics) in concurrent mode with a Bachelor of Engineering will need to substitute some level II courses in the Engineering program. For more information see the
School of Mathematics and Statistics
website.
