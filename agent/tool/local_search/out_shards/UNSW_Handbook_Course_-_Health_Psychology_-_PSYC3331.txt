Description
This course aims to introduce students to some of the major theoretical and empirical work in Health Psychology.  Its primary focus will be on the promotion and maintenance of health-related behaviour and the prevention of illness.  The course will begin with a brief overview of core material in the discipline of psychology with an emphasis on personality, social and developmental psychology.  The application of that knowledge will then cover health promotion strategies and methods (for example, improving diet-related behaviour and attitudes, initiating and maintaining exercise programs), and disease prevention skills and behaviours (for example, coronary heart disease, cancer, and smoking related problems).
