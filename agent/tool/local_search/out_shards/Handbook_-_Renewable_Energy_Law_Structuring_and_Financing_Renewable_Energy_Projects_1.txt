The sustained growth in renewable energy is transforming energy markets globally – and playing a major role in helping all countries meet their Paris Agreement targets. But at the same time the fast-paced growth is challenging the ability of existing energy markets and grids to absorb these intermittent energy sources. Sitting in the midst of policy, politics and economics that drive renewable energy markets, Renewable Energy Law has been designed as a practical ‘hands on’ postgraduate course to equip students with the legal, policy and commercial contracting skills to help private and public sector actors develop, build and finance “bankable” renewable energy projects. The course will provide participants with: (i) familiarity with key technical aspects of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, pumped hydro, energy from waste, batteries); (ii) a solid understanding (and ability to critique) different regulatory and policy frameworks that help drive increased penetration of renewable and related energy technologies into energy markets (such as feed-in tariffs, reverse auctions, renewable energy certificate schemes, tax credits); and (iii) the ability to identify, analyse and allocate legal and commercial risks in core project agreements (power offtake, construction and operations, grid connection) that support the structuring and financing of a renewable energy project.
Main topics
Overview of key technical aspects of renewable energy technologies
