This course offers a comprehensive exploration of renewable energy law and policy, preparing students for impactful careers in both public and private sectors. Through an in-depth examination of Australia’s energy and climate change policies, regulatory frameworks, market dynamics, and environmental requirements, students gain insights into sustainable energy solutions via legal and policy mechanisms. Delving into both public and private elements, including international legal commitments and contractual drafting, students develop a nuanced understanding of how Australia’s energy transition can be successfully managed. Unique practical components, such as contract drafting and role-playing as legal and policy advisors, will ensure students have the skills to address key issues while fostering an understanding of the symbiotic relationship between policy and law. Through immersive exercises, students navigate legal and commercial complexities, equipping them with pragmatic skills for success in this dynamic sector.
