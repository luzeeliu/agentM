This course builds on an elementary knowledge of physics (Year 12 physics or equivalent). Students will develop their ability to use mathematics and fundamental physical concepts to solve problems related to the world around them. It is a calculus based course where concepts and principles are learned in context, by example, and then developed through practice solving problems. Throughout the course, the skills of problem solving are refined by knowing when and how to apply the principles of physics, mathematics and other relevant tools.
There are no pre-requisites but there is assumed knowledge of Year 12 Physics (or equivalent) and Mathematics Extension1 (or equivalent) and a co-requisite mathematics course has to be taken, which can be either Mathematics 1A (DPST1013) OR Fundamentals of Mathematics B (DPST1012).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
