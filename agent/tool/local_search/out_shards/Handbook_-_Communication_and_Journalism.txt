This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Choosing a minor in Communication and Journalism will equip you with a selection of knowledge, skills, and experience you need to succeed in journalism and communication.
You’ll be able to acquire practical skills and critical perspectives on the fast-changing world of digital journalism, public communication, and news media. Learning how to tell stories effectively, ethically, and powerfully will be at the core of this minor, ranging from the page to the screen to virtual reality environments. You’ll be encouraged to explore how to become an influential, entrepreneurial, and strategic communicator able to take a leadership role, tackle complex issues, and take part in a global industry.
Ethics and justice are inseparable from how we teach, so you will leave UNSW with a strong understanding of how diversity, difference, and power play out in journalism and other media industries.
