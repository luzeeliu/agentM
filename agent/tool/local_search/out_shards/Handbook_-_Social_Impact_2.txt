The
Graduate Certificate in Social Impact
focuses on building the professional capacity of social managers and entrepreneurs of the future, across the corporate, government and third (not-for-profit) sectors, enhancing their capacity to lead organisations creating social and environmental value and to operate in a changed cross-sector social landscape where the dynamism of the market is also directed at social innovation.
This century has witnessed an accelerating economic relationship and a blurring of the boundaries between government, business and the third sector to deliver social (including environmental) value in communities. These factors are also powerful drivers of social innovation. Key changes have occurred within each of the sectors: the changing role of government from direct provider to enabler; the emergence of corporate responsibility within the business sector; the emergence of social enterprises and socially responsible businesses within the third sector. The interdependencies of the global economy also heighten the value of cross-sector experience for business students particularly in the consequent implications for leadership and management generally.
The Graduate Certificate in Social Impact is designed for a new generation of leaders:
Those who seek a leadership career in social enterprises, and those already in the sector who wish to enhance their professional capacity to create social and environmental value through leadership of third sector/not-for-profit organisations;
Those who aspire to hold executive positions in companies which are committed to maximizing social benefit and meeting corporate responsibilities through their products and practices;
Those who wish to become senior public administrators working with community groups, or public service executives with a responsibility for developing the public policy framework utilizing and understanding of social impact and social and
Those individuals and foundations that seek to ensure that their social investment delivers desirable social impact.
