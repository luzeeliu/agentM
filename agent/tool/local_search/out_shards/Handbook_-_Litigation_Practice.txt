This course focuses on the lawyer’s role in the management and resolution of civil disputes. It covers the relevant skills, values and competencies for civil litigation practice prescribed by the Legal Profession Admission Rules 2015, Schedule 2 (Practical legal training competencies for entry-level lawyers).
This course provides the opportunity to build on, consolidate and apply your knowledge and understanding of substantive law and court processes attained during your law degree to complete tasks and activities that reflect the work lawyers undertake in conducting civil litigation matters in legal practice. It will use and further develop your writing, drafting, legal research, analytical and problem-solving skills, in the context of representing a client throughout the different stages of a civil dispute matter – from the initial stage of assessing and advising on the merits of a client’s case to taking steps to enforce court orders and settlement agreements.

This course can also be undertaken on a non-award basis.
