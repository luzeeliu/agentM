Description
This studio investigates a large scale and complex urban development (or redevelopment) area, usually in Sydney or another major urban centre in NSW. A broad analysis of the social, economic, environmental and regulatory factors shaping urban form is followed by the development of an urban design framework for future development. The emphasis is on creating socially responsible and commercially feasible urban environment with reference to current city making principles, in particular sustainable development, urban consolidation and transit oriented development.
