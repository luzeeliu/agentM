Description
This course is offered in the summer semester and may be taken as a general education course by non Science/Med Sc students as there are no prerequisites. It can be taken as a Science elective by Science students.
The course focuses on topics in primatology, palaeoanthropology and physical anthropology that are particularly relevant to the evolution of human structure. It will be delivered by a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical classes, which will be held in the Gross Anatomy Laboratory (101) of the Wallace Wurth Building. Lecture topics range from “The Origin and Early Evolution of Primates” to “Modern Homo sapiens in the Old World” to “Language, Speech and the Human Face”.
Biology, anatomy and evolution of primates, early hominins through to modern humans will be covered. Students will also participate in a practical anthropology activity that may include facial reconstruction of human ancestors and making models of ancient tools.
