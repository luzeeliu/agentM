This course introduces you to histories and theories of Australian Art. Rather than taking a chronological approach, this course engages with key themes that inform the work of Australian artists, writers and curators, indigenous and non-indigenous. Like all official histories, the conventional history of Australian Art often excludes diverse perspectives. To address this, particular attention is paid to the ways in which colonial systems exclude minority groups, practices, and debates. In its place, this course connects you with emerging intersectional approaches spanning settler-colonial studies, critical whiteness studies, and feminist and decolonial theories. Throughout the course, you will develop deeper understandings of Australian art's multiple histories as well as a grounding from which you can develop your practice as emergent artists, thinkers and cultural workers within local contexts.
