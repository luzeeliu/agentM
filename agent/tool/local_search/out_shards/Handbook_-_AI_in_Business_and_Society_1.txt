AI and Large Language Models (LLM) will normalise access to disparate knowledge domains and allow humans to carry out quick and efficient exploration of their different configurations and connections to create new knowledge. This era of knowledge experimentation is upon us. The emphasis no longer lies in truthful answers but in truthful questions, ones that are valuable and grounded in reality. Meaningful and truthful questions that will advance society do not emerge without authentic motivation and immersing in critical societal domains such as technology, history, human behaviour, philosophy, and economics. This marks the era of neo-Renaissance, where individual character, morality, and strong cultural knowledge are critical to wield these technological tools to advance society in a positive way.
The
AI in Business and Society
major equips students with the tools to navigate and shape the evolving role of AI in industries and societies. Through four core courses, students will build a solid foundation in AI technologies, responsible practices, and human-AI collaboration. The major includes three electives, providing flexibility for students to tailor their learning to specific interests. The inclusion of undertaking a capstone project as the fourth elective allows students to apply AI knowledge to real-world challenges, fostering leadership and innovation.
Emphasising ethical, legal, and sustainability frameworks, the major encourages a global perspective, respecting cultural diversity and preparing students to lead forward-thinking initiatives. Graduates will be equipped to contribute to societal advancement in an AI-driven world, generating innovative human-centred solutions and promoting responsible AI use for a better society.
