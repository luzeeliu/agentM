This course introduces students to the world of law, legal systems and legal scholarship. Its objective is to enable students with little to no knowledge of law to gain understanding of basic legal concepts such as the rule of law or the functions of courts and parliaments. It introduces students to the idea that law and lawyers work and function in a globalized environment, and the implications of that on 21st lawyering. In addition, students will gain knowledge of how to conduct high level research in law, both on domestic and international matters. The course will also dedicate some time to develop legal writing techniques, in order to prepare students for their studies and for their life in practice. Students who have completed a law degree in Australia may not undertake LAWS8213 Legal Concepts Research and Writing as part of their program.
