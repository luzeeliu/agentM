The course enhances your Honours research by helping you to identify key professional practice skills, attributes, and aspirations aligned with your practice, research, and professional interests. The course brings students together from across Art & Design Honours programs to explore and share a multitude of research and career trajectories. By asking you to pro-actively identify pathways, precedents, and opportunities that align with your current project and future interests, the course encourages you to consider how you can build on your research for contexts beyond the frameworks of the Honours year. Whether you are interested in developing an independent practice, working collaboratively, engaging with industry, seeking employment, and/or postgraduate study, this course is designed to enhance your repertoire of skills for a successful transition post-Honours. The course also actively contributes to your Honours project by facilitating the integration of professional practice skills in your research and seeking critical feedback through an open studio event showcasing your works in progress.
