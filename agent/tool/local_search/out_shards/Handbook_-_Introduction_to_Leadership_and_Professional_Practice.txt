Graduate employers recruit students who demonstrate the potential to lead their organisations into the future. As such,
Introduction to Leadership and Professional Practice
will explore leadership from a developmental perspective. Students will investigate the attributes of effective leadership and examine their own potential for leadership through an assisted process of self-assessment and reflection. Students will be introduced to key leadership theories and research to enable critical engagement with the concept of leadership and to give a broader framework to think about their experiences and development needs.
Another focus will centre on exploring leadership in the context of team work. We will examine how leadership is related to interpersonal behaviour, the process of communication, the capacity to motivate others and self-manage (emotional intelligence).  By developing these skills sets, everyone has the potential to provide leadership within a work environment.
Finally we will examine the role of professionals in society, and the codes of ethics and practice that support standards within professional practice. Overall the course aims to prepare students to enter the workforce with a better understanding of the contribution they can make as leaders, team members and professionals.
The course will be delivered via online engagement and workshop participation.
