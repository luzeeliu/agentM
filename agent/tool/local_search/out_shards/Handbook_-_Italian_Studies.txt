This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Italian Studies enables you to explore the long and fascinating linguistic and cultural heritage of one of Australia’s most important migrant groups and equip you with appropriate knowledge and skills for communicating in the Italian language. Through language study, you will acquire an understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which the Italian language is used and develop an understanding of Italy, its place in the world and its legacy in Australia.
At UNSW, Italian Studies combines the teaching of practical language skills with the study of history, society, culture and customs. You will gain knowledge and skills relevant to a wide range of career paths from business, trade and commerce to diplomacy, tourism and the media.

Cross-Institutional Arrangement with the University of Sydney
keyboard_arrow_down
If you undertake Italian Studies as a minor, you may complete some components of your study through cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney. Once you successfully complete Italian courses cross-institutionally, you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, that is, specific grades will not appear on your UNSW transcript.
If you are a Commonwealth-supported student (domestic undergraduate student) in a UNSW program you need to pay the student contribution amounts at the University of Sydney for each course. If you are an international student you need to pay the corresponding tuition fees.
You will be required to pay the Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) at the University of Sydney. You may seek a refund for the corresponding UNSW fees if you are concurrently enrolled at UNSW.
You are responsible for all travel and any ancillary or incidental costs or expenses.
In undertaking cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney, you are responsible for ensuring that all the requirements for their application are completed and submitted by the deadlines advertised.
The cross-institutional arrangement with the University of Sydney is subject to annual review by both Universities. It may be discontinued or varied at any time at the Universities’ sole discretion. If the arrangement is discontinued, UNSW will put in place alternative arrangements so that you can finish your study.
Please note, if you are considering cross-institutional study you should contact the Nucleus Student Hub.
