Law in the Global Context is a core course that responds to the  changing nature of law in Australia and around the world - namely the  increasing interdependence of legal systems and the infusion of  international law into Australian law and institutions.  The course  introduces students to various areas of law having an international  dimension, in particular public international law, private international  law, comparative law and transnational law. It will concentrate on key  themes and emerging trends in these areas through case studies and in  depth consideration of the law in action. It will also  specifically introduce students to the interaction of 'global law' with  the different branches of Australian law studied in other compulsory  courses.  The course will instil in students an appreciation of the  essential notions that underpin international, transnational and  comparative law, such as sovereignty, private international law, and  transplantation of law.  Students will additionally undergo a series of  tutorials on researching and writing about law in a global context.
