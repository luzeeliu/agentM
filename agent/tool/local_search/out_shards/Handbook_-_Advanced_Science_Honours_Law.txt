This Handbook is for commencing students. If you commenced in a prior year please refer to the Online Handbook in the year you started your Law degree or contact the Faculty of Law for advice.
The Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) is designed to challenge students with an interest in critical thinking, research and innovation. The development of depth of understanding and practical skills in a discipline is a key part of the program, however, the degree also focuses on instilling a culture of research and enquiry through early induction into the research ethos and access to research groups and facilities.
The Law courses satisfy the requirements for the award of the professional LLB degree.
