Environmental history is an emerging field of study that reorients historical narratives around the progression of human-nature interactions. It offers distinctive ways of looking at the past to provide a context for understanding environmental change. In this course, you will be introduced to topics and debates within environmental history, engaging with key concepts, themes, and methods. You will develop a critical understanding of how environmental history developed as a sub-field, and how it has been subsequently shaped by different disciplines and approaches. Drawing on global and local examples, you will develop a deep appreciation of how the environmental and social are historically entangled. You will cultivate an appreciation of how environmental history offers a different lens through which to understand the past, providing new perspectives for engaging in historical and contemporary debates.
