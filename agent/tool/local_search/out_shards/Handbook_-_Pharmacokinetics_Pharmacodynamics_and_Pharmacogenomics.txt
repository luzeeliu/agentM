In this course you will build on the pharmacological knowledge you have gained from the Introductory Pharmacology for Pharmacy course.  You will develop proficiency in the areas of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics.  There will be a key focus on the role of a pharmacist in the safe and effective use of drugs. The pharmacokinetic component will explore the impact of route of administration on the time course of drug action, including variability in the amount and time taken during drug absorption, the movement of drugs around the body and their metabolism and excretion. Pharmacokinetic modelling will provide an understanding of the mathematical application of pharmacokinetics. The pharmacodynamics section will build on previous knowledge with a more detailed focus on drug targets.  This will lead into the final section of the course: the effects of genetics, disease and demographics on the individual response to drugs. The basic science of pharmacogenetics will be introduced which underpins the prediction of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variability in patients.
