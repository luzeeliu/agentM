This course builds on an elementary knowledge of chemistry (equivalent to one year of high school chemistry, such as Year 11 chemistry, or CHEM1001 at UNSW) to explore the quantum mechanical structure of atoms leading to an understanding of the periodic trends in the properties of the elements. This knowledge is applied to understanding chemical bonding and intermolecular forces which together are responsible for determining the properties of materials. General principles of chemical equilibrium are developed and applied to chemical reactions involving acids and bases. The applications of the laws of Thermodynamics to chemical processes are described and ultimately linked to chemical equilibrium. The course involves an overview of chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including their applications in biology, corrosion and energy storage for portable electronic devices.
The theoretical content of the course is delivered through a combination of online lessons, workshops and lectures. This includes a weekly workshop designed to support you building a solid foundation in the fundamental concepts covered in each topic.
Your understanding of more advanced concepts and problem-solving skills is developed in weekly online group-based tutorial classes. Theory is combined with the practical aspects of chemistry in weekly online laboratory classes.
Note:
1. Assumed knowledge equivalent to year 11 chemistry or CHEM1001.
2. Students cannot subsequently enrol in CHEM1001 after completing CHEM1511. However, students may complete CHEM1001 followed by CHEM1511.
3. Course runs on request, contact school for more information.
