Economics is a social science which studies the ways in which people interact with one another and make decisions in a world with limited resources. The goal of this course is to provide you with the basic tools to “think like an economist” – that is, to be able to use basic economic principles to ask and answer questions about how the world works or the effects of policies. We will cover topics such as how individuals or firms make decisions about the demand or supply of a product, how we can determine the efficiency of a market, and how we evaluate the costs and benefits of government intervention in a market.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
