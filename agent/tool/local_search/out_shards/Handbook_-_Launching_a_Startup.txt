This course aims to provide students with the skills necessary to start and grow a startup idea. Whilst some aspects of entrepreneurship can be learned from case studies, research on entrepreneurship education has shows that a learn-by-doing approach is most effective. During the course students form teams, identify potential business opportunities and utilise enquiry based learning to assess the viability of their business model. Each team will receive deep mentor engagement along the way. Students will also gain access to comprehensive resources designed to accelerate learning and ensure that they are equipped with the tools to become successful entrepreneurs. Students studying this course will access the minds of successful, highly articulate and innovative entrepreneurs (guest speakers) who live and breathe business. Thinking innovatively, creating a business, and developing a team are core entrepreneurial skills that the course teaches.
Topics covered in this course include: identifying a problem, identifying the target market, building a minimum viable product to address that problem, determining a suitable revenue model, pricing strategy, debt and equity finance, creating a budget, legal aspects of commencing a startup, accounting aspects of commencing a startup, sales and marketing, people and culture, raising capital, growth and exit strategy.
