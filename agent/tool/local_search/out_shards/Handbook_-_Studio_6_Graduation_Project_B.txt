This culminating capstone studio project will extend research and development undertaken in DDES3100 through to the translation of research findings and design concepts into realised design solutions in the form of a Graduation Project. The completed project will demonstrate the synthesis of previously learned disciplinary specialisations, theory, research, and practice studies with reference to more than one disciplinary specialisation in the finished project. You will be required to develop a rigorous and legible design process and demonstrate design management of the project. You will show leadership in the social, ethical and environmental impact of your design solution and apply your skills to clear documentation and presentation of an integrated design outcome.
