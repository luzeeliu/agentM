In this course students are introduced to Aboriginal Sydney through local written and oral histories, as well as notable works in film, performance, television and art, seeking to make visible Aboriginal experiences, lives and connections to place in the city. Different approaches to urban history and to understanding the relationship between identity, memory and place are discussed against the broader context of imperial and colonial history and the marginalisation of Aboriginal land and heritage. With a specific focus on doing place-specific research, students are encouraged to get outside of the classroom and visit the places they are learning about.
