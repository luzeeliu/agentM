In this course you will learn a range of strategies for focusing on music in detail. You will be taught how to analyze music in a sustained and particular manner. More broadly, you will gain a better understanding of some of the problems - of technique, of experience, of description - that motivate music and its analysis. So in addition to specific ways of analyzing music, the course will include discussions of readings that are relevant to each method.
