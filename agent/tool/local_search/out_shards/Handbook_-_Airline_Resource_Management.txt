Airline operations are the key areas involved in managing aircraft and providing related services. This course will concentrate on airline resources management and examine these concepts from the perspective of equipment and crew scheduling within airline management. There is strong continuity between managing the ‘corporate’ aspects of the airline (covered in AVIA3101) and the operational aspects (covered in this course). This mainly occurs in the planning processes, including fleet planning, aircraft scheduling, and crew scheduling. These important processes will be taught in this course from the perspective of resource allocation, utilisation, and optimisation. Some relevant topics are also covered in this course, such as aircraft maintenance scheduling, airport ground operations, and flight on-time performance management.
