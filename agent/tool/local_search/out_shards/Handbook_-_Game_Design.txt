The Game Design minor allows you to develop skills and knowledge for the fast-evolving field of game design practice. In this minor, you will be encouraged to explore a range of key concepts and principles informing game design and development including interactive narrative, player experience, game mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. As you develop your creative portfolio, you will also experiment with a range of industry-relevant technical skills and workflows in custom-designed creative studios and professionally equipped facilities. The minor features a series of core studio courses focusing specifically on the foundations of game design practice, as well as complementary courses in related fields of digital and media arts practice. With this combination, the minor enables you to develop a repertoire of skills and knowledge in game design as well as approaches applicable in a range of complementary and interdisciplinary fields. The minor is designed for creative practitioners who are keen to explore and experiment with the diverse possibilities of game design practice.
