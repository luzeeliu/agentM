Description
This course provides an introduction to the Master of Environmental Management program. You will gain an appreciation of the complex and trans-disciplinary nature of environmental issues and of the inherent challenges in multi-disciplinary approaches to environmental management. The emphasis is on exploring conceptual and practical frameworks and global strategies for adaptive environmental management. Starting from the premise of "sustainable development goals" as a current broadly-endorsed framework for environmental management, your exploration will include the development of the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability and problems in practically interpreting and implementing sustainability. You will encounter a range of relevant perspectives including for example Indigenous world views, philosophy and ethics, social justice, planning, economics, health sciences, ecology, media, and cultural approaches. You will explore the principles of sustainable development in their application, including governance responses to the "sustainable development goals" at different levels of government, by non government organizations, by corporations, and by professional organizations. You will encounter critiques of sustainability as a framework for environmental management, and explore alternative models, and possible solutions.
