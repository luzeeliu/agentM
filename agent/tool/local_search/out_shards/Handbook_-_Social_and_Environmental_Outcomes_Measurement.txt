Across government, business, and the not-for-profit sector there is a growing demand for organisations to measure their social and environmental outcomes and impact while social enterprises in particular rely on the ability to evaluate and communicate their social and financial impact for investment and scalability.

What and how to measure, how to communicate outcomes and impact effectively, and how to manage the process of evaluation within an organisation are just some of the associated challenges. Beginning with an examination of ‘why measure’, this course will then turn to a practical application of ‘what and how to measure outcomes and impact’, how to communicate social and environmental measurement outcomes and impact to key stakeholders, and conclude with an assessment of how an outcomes and impact framework might facilitate organisations to deliver on their mission, support organisational learning, and provide capacity for organisational change and sustainability.
