This course presents an integrated approach to distribution strategy, retail channel management, and related aspects of logistics. Distribution involves the creation of product and service availability through marketing channels, retailing involves the management and marketing of assortments of merchandise for direct sale to the consumer, and logistics involves the creation of targeted levels of customer service through the distribution system. Students will examine a) distribution activities involved in getting consumer and business goods and services to market, b) the unique characteristics associated with retail marketing of merchandise assortments, and c) the strategic aspects of logistics as a marketing tool. In marketing management, quality products and good promotion efforts are not enough. Product and service assortments and availability levels must competitively match the wants of target market customers. Logistics decisions in marketing concern setting and managing appropriate levels and allocations of stock, levels of delivery service, and levels of associated physical distribution services to achieve marketing and distribution objectives.
