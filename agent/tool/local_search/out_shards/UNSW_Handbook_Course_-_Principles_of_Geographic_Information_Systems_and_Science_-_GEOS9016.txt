Description
Approximately 80% of all data collected have associated geographic attributes, and there is an increasing need for people with the skills and abilities to manipulate and make sense of that information. This course provides an introduction to, and understanding of, the basic principles, structures, procedures and applications of geographic information systems and science. Topics covered in the course provide a comprehensive overview and practical experience in the analytical treatment of geographical information, including: information sources; data storage, representation and visualisation; projections and coordinate systems; the analysis of spatial data to generate new information; and the dissemination of such digital information through avenues including the internet.
This course will be conducted through a combination of lectures, computer laboratories and field work.
