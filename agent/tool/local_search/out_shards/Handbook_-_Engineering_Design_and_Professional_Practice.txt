Design is one of the critical foundations of engineering and a main component in creating value. A good engineer has complex technical skills, but also creative skills, project management and teamworking skills, and knowledge of professional ethical standards in design.
DESN2000 aims to further develop your skills in engineering design with a particular focus on the early stages, where innovative concepts are created in response to open-ended problems. These skills will be developed in the context of an engineering project, with a focus on three areas: (1) research techniques needed to understand design problems and discover concepts, (2) technical skills needed to build a concept, and (3) evaluation methods for evaluating the concept. Alongside the development of design skills, the course also aims to develop your readiness for professional practice by deepening your understanding and skills in effective project management, teamwork and communication.
The course builds on the teamwork, communication, and project management skills introduced in DESN1000. Skills learned in DESN2000 are further deepened in DESN3000, which will develop skills for managing design in commercial context.
With DESN1000 and DESN3000, DESN2000 provides design skills described in Engineers Australia’s Stage 1 Competencies, especially competencies 1.3, 1.5, 1.6; 2., 2.3; and 3.2 and 3.6.
