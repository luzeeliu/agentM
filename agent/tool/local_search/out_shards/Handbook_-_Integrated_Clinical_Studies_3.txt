During this course students will undertake clinical terms in Beginnings, Growth and Development, Adult Health 2 and Geriatrics building on the learning in Phase 1.
Objectives of the Beginnings Growth and Development Term: - By using authentic clinical or practical experiences as the basis for learning, students will build upon their understanding of the biomedical, behavioural and social science principles involved in the human life cycle stages spanning conception to adulthood. In addition, students will develop understandings of the clinical aspects of illnesses relevant to this stage, whilst extending their capabilities in communication with, and physical examination of, patients with specified health issues. The issues covered include gynaecology and sexual health issues in women of reproductive age, normal pregnancy and delivery, pregnancy complications, the healthy neonate and normal infant development, acute illness and injury in young children, chronic conditions in childhood and adolescent health.
Objectives of Adult Health 2 Term: - By using authentic clinical or practical experiences as the basis for learning, students will build upon their understanding of the internal and external mechanisms that maintain health or lead to disease. In addition, students will develop understandings of the clinical aspects of relevant illnesses, whilst extending their capabilities in communication with, and physical examination of, patients with specified health issues. Major systems such as the locomotor, musculoskeletal and neurological systems as well as specific senses and metabolic diseases, will be studied in a clinical context covering acute, chronic and complex presentations, supported by teaching in the basic and social sciences.
Objectives to the Geriatrics Term: - By using authentic clinical or practical experiences as the basis for learning, students will build upon their understanding of the specific health issues faced by elders that they established in phase 1. In addition, students will develop understandings of the clinical aspects of illnesses occurring in elders, whilst extending their capabilities in communication with, and physical examination of, patients with specified health issues. Typical clinical issues encountered will include complex co-morbidity problems in elders, chronic illness and disability, degenerative diseases including arthritis and dementia, rehabilitation, palliative care and cancer medicine, stroke, vascular disease, and terminal illness.
For Integrated Clinical Studies 3, a case-based teaching methodology is employed to link acquisition of clinical and public health capabilities with the learning of mechanisms and principles underlying health and illness. Approximately 60 of available time will be spent in clinical and community environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine, in which students will encounter patients or health issues relevant to the domain themes. These experiences will be augmented by a range of tutorials, laboratory classes, and face-to-face and/or electronic resources.
Assessment will include submission of group projects and assignment reports, demonstrating integration/ correlation of prior and current learning with linkage to basic biomedical sciences; medical imaging and diagnostic tests; ethics; or population health issues. In addition, the student's clinical performance during the module will be graded as satisfactory/unsatisfactory.
