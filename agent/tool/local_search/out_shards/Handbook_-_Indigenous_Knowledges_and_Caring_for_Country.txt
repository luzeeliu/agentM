Indigenous knowledge holders are working with how to articulate their knowledge practices and beliefs to non-Indigenous and non-local audiences. In this course, you will focus on ethical and equitable ways of integrating Indigenous and local knowledge systems with Western scientific knowledge systems to inform sustainability and conservation policy and practice. You will learn about appropriate and effective ways to share and combine these knowledge systems for collaborative environmental leadership. In the midst of global crises, including climate disruption, large scale extinctions, and exacerbated bushfires, you will rethink ways society can conceptualise environmental problems and conservation practices. In addition, you will investigate how to build regional, national, and global science policy that is inclusive of situated Indigenous and local knowledge systems without compromising the integrity or legitimacy of scientific, Indigenous, or local knowledge systems.
