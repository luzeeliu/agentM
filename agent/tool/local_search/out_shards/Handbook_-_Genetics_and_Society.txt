Genetic knowledge has advanced rapidly over the last few decades leading to a wide range of genetic applications in society. From genetically modified foods to genetic testing and precision medicine, these applications are now a part of everyday life. However, these advancements also raise important ethical, legal, and social questions that need to be considered.
How much of our lives is pre-determined by our DNA and how much control do we have over our genetic destiny? This course will introduce core genetic concepts and applications using real life examples in a variety of areas including forensics, sport, nutrition, human health, agriculture, and synthetic biology. The course also provides hands-on experience in analysing and interpreting genetic data, as well as the necessary skills to critically evaluate implications of genetic advances, so one can make informed decisions about genetic interventions in their daily lives.
The course is delivered fully online, supported by interactive asynchronous learning material and synchronous live tutorials. No prior science or genetics knowledge is required. The course is aimed at students from any field of study, who have a keen interest in understanding the genetic basis of life and the impact genomic applications have on societal practices.
