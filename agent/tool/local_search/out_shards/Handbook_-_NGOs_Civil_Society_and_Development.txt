In this course you will critically examine the complex role of civil society and NGOs in development activities and processes, with an emphasis on global development. In this course you will cover theoretical and practical insights concerning the role of civil society and NGOs and will learn about different types of organisations (such as humanitarian and development; faith-based; campaigning vs. service delivery) and their strategies, activities and approaches. You will explore the interfaces of these organisations and institutions with culture, gender, human rights, Indigenous rights, and dominant ideologies.  You will also explore the links between civil society, NGOs and other development actors, as well as their relationship to the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and key global challenges. You will be required to engage actively online, in class, independently and in a group. You will come from any of a range of disciplinary backgrounds and will want to learn how to make a difference in social justice, development and humanitarian settings.
