Human rights play a crucial role in the international political system. This course challenges you to analyse that role and major interpretations of that role. The course is concerned with the development of human rights across geographical, cultural and legal boundaries, in a dialogue between international human rights institutions and domestic politics. Please note that this is an International Relations course focussing on the interaction of law and politics in the area of human rights. It is not a Law course. No prior knowledge of international law is required. Accordingly, we cover the sources, core principles and concepts of human rights in international law; distinguish political from legal interpretations of human rights; and explore the relationship between domestic policy formulation and international law. The course examines the sources of human rights, the rights of individuals, the duties of states, and mechanisms of recognition and protection. It draws on comparative material from different jurisdictions to explore questions such as discrimination on the basis of race and sex, religious freedom, economic and social rights in development, and human rights in the context of addressing terrorism.
