Psychology is founded on the scientific method. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of scientific research in psychology. It will cover topics such as science and the scientific method; critical thinking skills; the practice and problems of valid and reliable measurement in psychology; different research methodologies, techniques and designs; and research data analysis. In addition, justification, definition and exploration of ethical guidelines for research will be discussed.
During this course students will develop a deeper understanding of empirically-based scientific thinking and analysis. This knowledge will allow students to scrutinise and critically evaluate published research and scientific evidence and to be able to effectively communicate statistical and research data in variety of formats and variety of contexts.
