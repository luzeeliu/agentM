Admission Requirements
Entry Requirements
Expand all
Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
To be admitted into the BEc(Hons) program, a student must have completed a Bachelors degree with a major in Economics, Econometrics, Business Economics, Financial Economics, or Business Strategy and Economic Management. A student in a dual degree may gain entry to the BEc(Hons) prior to completing the requirements for the dual degree program if they have completed 144 UOC including all requirements for the relevant major.
Students must have completed the equivalent of the following courses to be eligible for entry:
ECON2101 Microeconomics 2
ECON2102 Macroeconomics 2
plus an econometric course requirement that depends on the specialisation. For details, please refer to the relevant Honours specialisation.
It is also recommended that a student complete ECON3202 Mathematical Economics, or an equivalent, before commencing the BEc(Hons).
Students who have failed a course within their pass degree will not normally gain entry to the BEc(Hons) program.
A student must have an overall Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 70 (or equivalent) with a discipline/major WAM of at least 70. Due to the academic requirements of some disciplines and the competitive nature of honours places, the WAM required for entry may be higher.
The number of students accepted to the BEc(Hons) in a particular discipline is dependent on the availability of supervisors in that discipline. If there are more applicants than a discipline can accommodate, admission will be determined according to students' academic merit.
Full-time and part-time (during 3 semesters) study is available in this program. Mid-year entry to the BEc(Hons) is possible, but is typically recommended only for part-time study.
