Performance over Time of Building Systems introduces you to the analysis of the users’ needs in relation to related to the architectural space and translating these into performance-based requirements and specifications to prevent building defects and durability issues. You will investigate the durability of building envelope components and possible design countermeasures to the most common defects due to errors in conception, construction, or maintenance. Your detailed technological design will be informed by software simulations of the hygrothermal performance of building components. Finally, you will orient your work in relation to regulatory frameworks, including the National Construction Code and technical standards (e.g. AS/NZS or ISO standards), to develop specifications, and verify the delivered performance and building quality.
