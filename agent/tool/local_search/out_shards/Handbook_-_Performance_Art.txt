This studio course introduces you to the key creative principles for working with performance in the context of contemporary art. You will be introduced to a range of artistic methods and practices, spanning participation, choreography, improvisation, collaboration, and documentation, to develop performance techniques that can be applied in a variety of artistic contexts. Throughout the course, you will also be encouraged to develop your skills and knowledge in performance art by exploring the relationships between live actions, recorded works, and screen-based performances. Working individually and collaboratively in the studio, you will also explore the role of audiences, institutions, social environments, moving image, installation, and photography in framing and facilitating your own performance-based artworks.
