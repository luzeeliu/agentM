This course will teach students C++ programming in a mechatronic engineering context where interfacing with external devices is needed.
The courses in the Mechatronics discipline are built upon four different areas. They are: mechanical design, computing, electronics and microprocessors, and control systems. The latter three areas are interrelated, and this course forms a cornerstone of the fundamental courses on which the Mechatronic Engineering program at UNSW is built. A high level of programming skill is necessary to develop customised interface routines to communicate with/control various elements of Mechatronic systems. This knowledge is essential in programming control systems and developing software modules for the interfacing of various hardware elements together to form complete Mechatronic Systems.
Students enrolling in this course are expected to have a fundamental understanding of procedural programming, exposure to version control systems and experience with software design to the level expected in COMP2521.
