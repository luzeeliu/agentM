Computers are now ubiquitous, and critical to the functioning of all enterprises in modern industrial societies, from commerce to health and education. They now also play an important social role, opening new avenues for people to connect and to engage in public discourse. The demand for computing professionals capable of managing existing computing infrastructure or, more importantly, creating the next generation of computing applications, will continue to grow into the future.
This stream provides a solid grounding in the fundamentals of the computing discipline (programs, algorithms, design, systems, software engineering) and then allows students to choose from a wide range of electives in later years. The flexibility of the stream allows students to take a broad range of courses, or to focus on one particular area of computing.
This is the default plan for students in the 3778 BSc in Computer Science program or in dual degrees involving Computer Science.
