Design Collaboration Studio 3 is the final studio for the Bachelor of Design program and its three specialisations in Integrated Design, Industrial Design, and Computational Design.
The studio extends your critical, theoretical, and practical skills to an advanced level with a self-directed project. You will bring your research insights, discoveries, and ideas from your previous courses within your specialisation to further explore, develop, and realise within this studio. Guided by the expertise of discipline leaders, you will use rigorous prototyping and testing techniques and a systematic, research-informed process to individually iterate and resolve your final design outcome. You will apply the skills learned in previous studios to test and extend your thinking in collaboration with a community of peers from across a range of disciplines. This course will build on partnerships formed with industry mentors, clients, or stakeholders, responding to your project in a real-world context.
Upon completing this studio, you will have a portfolio-ready project that showcases the breadth and depth of your capabilities as an emerging design professional.
