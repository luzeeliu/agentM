The discipline of Molecular Cell Biology investigates how cells develop, operate, communicate, construct multicellular organisms, control their activities, and (on occasion) go awry. To study the properties of the molecules that contribute to all these activities, modern researchers employ concepts and experimental techniques drawn from biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics and cell biology. The course will present an overview of our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control cellular processes in health and disease and the techniques that are used to arrive at that understanding. Lectures presented in the course will cover molecular mechanisms of the recognition and interactions between cells, cell growth, intracellular signaling, genome and transcriptome regulation, plasma membrane and cytoskeleton organization, protein and lipid transport, and cellular stress. In addition, lectures on molecular mechanisms of conditions caused by dysregulation of these mechanisms, including growth disorders, cancer, obesity, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders will be given.
This advanced version of the BIOC3271 course includes a research project performed in laboratory classes. This course is designed to suit students who plan to pursue research careers in molecular cell biology or related disciplines.
This course is restricted to students enrolled in Advanced Sciences programs. Students in other programs can be enrolled in this course upon approval from the Course Authority.
