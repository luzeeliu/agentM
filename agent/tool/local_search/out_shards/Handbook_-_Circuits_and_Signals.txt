Electrical Engineering is concerned with three primary activities: the first deals with electricity and its direct control and use within electrical circuits (electronics, power systems, instrumentation, communications and so on). The second activity is concerned with modelling systems which use electricity as the primary source of energy for functioning. The third activity concerns the handling of data which relies on electrical phenomena (wired and wireless) for data transmission. ELEC2134 provides the fundamental techniques for carrying out the first two activities and will take your understanding of electrical circuits to new heights.
This course will enhance your understanding of simple and complex DC and AC circuits and circuit elements. You will explore AC power, power factor, and resonance, unravelling their implications in practical applications. With a solid foundation in AC analysis, you will be equipped to tackle complex challenges in power distribution, communications, and beyond in subsequent courses. From fundamental circuit elements to advanced network analysis, you will gain the skills to analyse electric and magnetic circuits. In addition to that, you will dive into network functions and frequency response, revealing the astounding interplay between electrical signals and linear systems such as circuits. You will explore the intricacies of time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis, which can provide invaluable insight into signals if properly used, equipping yourself with important tools to understand the behaviour of complex electrical systems in subsequent courses.
