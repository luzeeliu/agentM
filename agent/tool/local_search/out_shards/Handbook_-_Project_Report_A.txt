The project is an inquiry-based learning course that allows a team of students to combine engineering principles learned over their previous years of study and professional experience and apply them to innovatively solve problems, such as developing a specific design or process and/or investigating a hypothesis. Projects can take many forms, such as the design and construction of experimental equipment or a theoretical investigation.
The projects that students undertake are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for their creativity and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. There are multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning from the students. The project requires students to formulate problems in scientific or engineering terms, manage a technical project and find solutions by applying scientific and engineering methods.
This is the first course in the two-course project structure, carried out over two terms. The course is normally undertaken in the last year of the Master of Engineering Science program. Students undertake directed laboratory and research work on an approved topic under the guidance of an academic supervisor. Students must form a team, and identify a supervisor and project prior to enrolling in this course. A suitable co-supervisor may be required where the work is carried out externally.
