This is an introductory course in Modern Standard Chinese language (Mandarin) for non-background speakers. The course will start with basic components of Chinese language: the
pinyin
, and characters. It will teach you how the Chinese language works both grammatically and in socio-cultural contexts so that you start to develop your linguistic and communicative competences. The four language skills - Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing - are integrated throughout the course. A cultural awareness is also built into the course. Through language study you will develop an informed understanding of Chinese linguistic behaviour, society and culture.
This course is a beginners-level language course. All students must fill in the placement questionnaire available at https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/students/courses/language-placements. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you (for example, if you have had some experience with the language, either as a heritage language or through previous instruction). If the questionnaire shows this, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
