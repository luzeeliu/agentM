Performing linear algebra over a ring of scalars instead of a field leads to the notion of a module. The theory of modules is surprisingly subtle and has many applications, not only to other parts of mathematics but also to mathematical physics. This course focuses on the theory of modules over principal ideal domains and over semisimple rings. The first has applications to linear algebra. The second has applications to group representations which is essential to the study of symmetry. Topics include modules, modules over a principal ideal domain, group representations.
