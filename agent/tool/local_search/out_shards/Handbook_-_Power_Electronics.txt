Power electronic circuits are an essential requirement for renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles to name a few of the huge opportunities in the energy domain as well as for a whole array of consumer and industrial products. At the low power end, these may include switched-mode regulated power supplies for hand-held devices, TVs, light fittings, computers and other entertainment systems. At the high power end, there are diverse industrial applications in high voltage DC transmission, grid connections for wind generators and PV systems; Power supplies for telecommunication equipment, welding, furnaces, and smelting; Power electronic converters for variable-speed drives in automotive and railway traction and accessories, in steel rolling, textile, paper rolling mills, machine tools, robotic, disk and other automation drives, ship propulsion and positioning, aircraft actuators and navigation. Electronic processing of electrical power for these applications also provides the means to control these processes to obtain certain desirable goals such as energy efficiency, better product quality and accurate control of the manufacturing.
