Planning Practice: Institutions and Implementation is one of five courses designed to support your practice year. As a suite, these courses will provoke you to draw upon your own experiences to think more critically about the planning sector’s competing objectives and inform your development as a planning professional. In each of these courses you will bring real world examples of the opportunities and challenges of your professional placement into the classroom, and learn from the diversity of other students’ experiences, to integrate insights across theory and practice.
In this course you will come to better understand the institutional frameworks within which planners work, including state and local governments and the design, development and property industries. You will learn how institutional operations and environments shape your professional life and influence how your skills and expertise can effectively be applied. This includes learning to implement your skills by exploring and unpacking the considerations of project management, finances, constraints and delivery, working in transdisciplinary teams and networks, managing conflicts and troubleshooting difficulties.
