The course explores modern Japanese History from the imperial restoration of 1868 to after the Pacific War from an interdisciplinary perspective. It focuses on Japanese cultural, social and gender history. In it, you will learn about marginalised groups and movements of resistance; the 'new Japanese woman', café culture and sexwork from the 'roaring twenties'; prewar radical literature; and postwar popular culture. Political history topics include western-style modernisation and its discontents; nationalism and the emperor-system ideology; as well as Japan's wars and empire. A central theme is the ambivalent nature of progress (Japan's modern 'miracles' and their 'down-sides'), and contending representations of Japan and its place in Asia and the modern world.
