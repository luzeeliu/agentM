Professional Engineering and Communication is a subject designed to expose and involve students in a wide variety of topics and tasks which will be of lasting use going into Industrial Training, the final year thesis, and beyond that, a career in engineering. This course focuses on the non-technical aspects of engineering practice that centre around communication, ethical considerations, and professional conduct. Skills relating to problem solving, research, team working, and project planning and basic management will developed to standards expected of graduates entering the workplace - students are then expected to utilise and build on these skills in their final year to provide them with high-level skills that will make them sought after in the employment market.
Despite their non-technical nature, the concepts involved in this course are just as challenging as those that are involved in the technical analyses with which most engineering students are more familiar. A professional engineer can expect to find herself or himself working on several memos, reports and presentations at any given time - it is an essential part of performing effectively in industry. Therefore many tasks will be undertaken, some short and relatively simple, with others more complex and nuanced, partly reflecting the timelines and pressures of the working environment and providing an opportunity to work in different teams on different tasks. Analysis of team structures and interpersonal communication also forms part of the course, as aspects of teamwork such as leadership, conflict resolution, managing differing technical skill levels and cultural backgrounds are vital in professional practice and must be appreciated as useful skills for the engineer.
The centrepiece of the course is a group research project on an area pertinent to modern engineering. This, along with guest lectures from industry professionals will be used to provide insight into the working relationships between professional engineers, clients and management in order to prepare students for the workforce.
