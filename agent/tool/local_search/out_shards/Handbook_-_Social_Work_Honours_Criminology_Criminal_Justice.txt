Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC.
Social Work (Honours)
Core courses (168 UOC)
Criminology and Criminal Justice
Criminology & Criminal Justice Core (42 UOC)
Social Science Core (36 UOC) - see double counting and substitution rules below for SOSS1000, SOSS1001, and SOSS3003/SOSS3008
Prescribed Criminology Electives (18 UOC) - ARTS2871 will be counted as a Criminology Elective (see double counting rules below), and students will complete a further 12 UOC of Criminology Electives
Double Counting and Course Substitution
Two of the core courses (12 UOC) in Criminology and Criminal Justice, SOSS1000 and SOSS1001 are also part of the core for Social Work (Honours). Therefore these two courses will be double counted towards this double degree.
In addition, ARTS2871 will also double count towards the double degree as a core course for Social Work (Honours) and a Prescribed Criminology Elective for Criminology and Criminal Justice. Students will complete a further 12 UOC of Criminology Electives.
Students enrolled in this double degree must take SOSS3008 instead of SOSS3003. SOSS3008 (6 UOC) will be counted towards the requirement to take SOSS3003 in the Criminology and Criminal Justice disciplinary component.
