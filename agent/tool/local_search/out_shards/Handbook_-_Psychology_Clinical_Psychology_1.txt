The combined Doctor of Philosophy/Master of Psychology (Clinical) program offers advanced training in research skills that are particularly relevant to clinical areas, and requires a minimum of four full-time years to complete.
It is accredited by the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) as the fifth and sixth years of study and graduates are eligible to apply for full membership of the Australian Psychological Society (APS) and registration as a psychologist with the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA). After completing a Psychology Board of Australia approved Clinical Psychology registrar program, graduates of the program are eligible to apply for APS College of Clinical Psychology Fellowship and endorsement as a Clinical Psychologist.
Alongside a compulsory coursework component, students will work on their research project during the entire candidature until submission, and the same research-related requirements as the stand-alone PhD program (1400) will apply for the duration of candidature. University regulations and guidelines for good practice in postgraduate research supervision will apply to this program.

UNSW Higher Degree Research Learning Outcomes

Minimum Entry Requirements
Prior to submitting an application, it must be established if supervision is available within the School. An academic’s willingness and ability to supervise is
not
a guarantee of admission.
Applications must be approved by the School, the Faculty and the Graduate Research School, and an applicant for whom appropriate supervision or research infrastructure is not available cannot be admitted.
The minimum entrance requirement is completion of an accredited four-year, or three-year plus a fourth year, APAC-accredited sequence in psychology, including a major research thesis, completed within the last 10 years with Honours Class 1 (85%) or equivalent.
Psychology qualifications from overseas must include a major research thesis/project and must be assessed by the Australian Psychological Society (
APS
) as comparable to a four-year APAC-accredited sequence of study in psychology completed in Australia.
As the number of places available each year is limited, entry into the program is competitive. Selection is based on academic qualifications, two referee reports, and performance at an interview. Only shortlisted applicants will be invited to participate in an interview (remote participation may be permitted in limited circumstances).
Applicants should refer to both the School of Psychology’s
How to Apply
page, and
Graduate Research School's website
for more detail about the application procedure and requirements.
Registration as a Provisional Psychologist
Enrolled students must register as provisional psychologists prior to program commencement. Registration must be maintained for the duration of their enrolment.
Prospective applicants, regardless of current residency or citizenship status, should familiarise themselves with the
registration standards
and are encouraged to review AHPRA's "
Pathways diagram
" relating to the English language skills standard.
Requirements
Prospective applicants should familiarise themselves with the program's
inherent requirements

Additional Information
Note that the information listed under the Handbook entry for the
Master of Psychology (Clinical) program
relating to Recognition of Prior Learning and Study Load and Duration also apply to this Combined program.
Supervision
If you are considering applying for a PhD with the School of Psychology, you must first make contact with the School. This will help to establish that your research interests are aligned with those of the School and Faculty, and that there is suitable supervision available for your particular area of research. You can search the School's
Areas of Expertise
page, or the
Find a Researcher
page for more information.
For further information on policies, procedures and forms, see the
Graduate Research
website. For additional admission information see the
Admission to Higher Degree Research Programs Procedure
.
Professional Placement
Each Professional and Ethical Practice (PEP) course is linked with either 1) a Readiness Module and/or 2) satisfactory progress on or successful completion of a professional placement. Until the necessary components of a PEP course have been successfully completed (or satisfactory progress has been made), a PE grade will be applied to the course. Failure to meet placement requirements and/or successfully complete the placement (as determined by program authorities) will lead to failure of the PEP course. If the Readiness Module or any professional placement is not completed to a satisfactory standard, or placement requirements have not been met, a UF grade will be applied to the PEP course. Hours from a professional placement that is not completed to a satisfactory standard will NOT count towards the minimum 1000 hours of supervised practical placement experience required for completion of the program.
All students in the Master’s or Combined psychology program will enrol in PSYC7777 throughout their program. This assessment-based course facilitates placements across terms and includes a final reflection task on competency acquisition.
Course Fail
Should a student fail any course, approval to re-enrol in the failed course will be at the discretion of the Program Director (and Placement Coordinator, in the case of PEP courses)^. If approval is not granted, the Program Director may recommend discontinuation from the Combined PhD/Master of Psychology program and a transfer into the stand-alone Doctor of Philosophy program (Program Code 1400).
^ In Australia, the psychology profession is regulated by the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act as overseen by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). The School of Psychology is responsible for adhering to federally legislated professional and accreditation standards for training provisionally registered psychologists in full compliance with the APS Code of Ethics and Ethical Guidelines. Master of Psychology students, as provisionally registered psychologists, are expected to display the competencies, professionalism and reputable behaviours the discipline demands. In making their recommendation, the Program Director will consider these factors not simply from an academic standpoint, but as the discipline's chief authority on such professional and ethical matters within the program.
Should a student disagree with a recommendation made by the Program Director, their avenue of appeal will be to the Head of School and/or School Board.
