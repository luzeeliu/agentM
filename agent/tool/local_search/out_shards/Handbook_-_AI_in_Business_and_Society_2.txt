Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way businesses operate and societies function. As organisations adopt AI to drive efficiency, insight, and innovation, there is growing demand for professionals who can bridge technical understanding with business acumen. Meeting this demand requires more than familiarity with AI technologies — it calls for individuals who can think strategically, communicate effectively, and evaluate the broader impacts of AI on people, systems, and institutions.
The
AI in Business and Society
specialisation equips Master of Commerce students with essential AI literacy that extends beyond technical proficiency. Students will develop the ability to assess AI’s organisational implications, communicate across diverse teams, and engage thoughtfully with responsible and strategic considerations. The specialisation encourages active reflection on responsible use of AI, with an emphasis on inclusive decision-making, long-term impact, and stakeholder collaboration. Graduates will be prepared to contribute meaningfully to AI adoption and governance, not just as practitioners, but as informed participants in organisational change.
Through the core courses, students will build a strong foundation in AI technologies, responsible AI practices, and human-AI collaboration and applications. Students will also have the opportunity to choose elective courses from various MCOM disciplines that explore AI-related topics within those fields. The specialisation highlights human-centred and ethically aligned approaches to AI, preparing students to navigate global business environments, lead cross-functional teams, and foster innovation grounded in cultural awareness and professional integrity.  Designed to prepare future leaders in a rapidly evolving digital economy, this AI specialisation equips MCOM students with the skills and mindset to harness AI responsibly and strategically—enabling them to drive innovation, build trust, and create meaningful value in business and society.
