In this course, you will explore exciting macromolecular chemistry in a range of selected cutting-edge research fields. Forget packaging and injection moulded products, today’s chemical engineers, product engineers, and chemists are developing amazing applications of polymer science. These new polymers are complex macromolecules and find applications in food and health, water treatment, and renewable energy. This course will build on basic knowledge of polymers (from CEIC8104 Topics in Polymer Technology, or similar courses) and discuss the latest developments in polymer science, with a strong focus on polymer chemistry and polymer synthesis.
A particular focus will be controlled/living radical polymerisation techniques (NMP, ATRP, RAFT), which allow precise synthesis of advanced macromolecular structures and functional polymeric materials. The synthetic strategies will be discussed at length, including their implementation in dispersed systems (emulsion etc).
This course is helpful for students undertaking research in polymer science at a postgraduate level.
