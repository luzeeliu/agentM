This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Specialising in Media Studies as part of your Bachelor of Media at UNSW will give you the critical skills and knowledge you need to understand, analyse, and respond to the pivotal role of media in contemporary life.
We take as our starting point the proposition that media are much more than news organisations or social platforms: media are fundamental to life, culture, politics, and history. After building a firm foundation in media studies debates, methods, and history, you’ll choose from a suite of electives that allow you to sharpen your focus on questions of justice, race, ethics, or emerging technologies.
You will develop critical thinking and writing skills that allow you to make persuasive arguments, engage with challenging issues, and solve new problems. With an array of research methods and analytical techniques in your toolkit, you’ll be able to bring to bear a combination of critical and creative skills and knowledges.
When you graduate, you’ll be ready to work across the media industries of today – and with the critical knowledge and skills you need to adapt to whatever the future brings.
