Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared, or used. Privacy Engineering is the discipline concerned with applying an engineering approach to the analysis of privacy problems and the design of solutions in a systematic and sometimes formal manner.  It is concerned with data privacy and overall system privacy, including legal and ethical privacy goals.
The course provides a comprehensive overview of the field of “Privacy Engineering” and in-depth knowledge on information theoretic concepts and mechanisms for achieving privacy goals, including legal and ethical privacy goals. The course is designed to provide understanding of state-of-the-art privacy-preserving mechanisms including formal and human centric approaches, and the design and assessment of systems with privacy requirements and how to attack them. Students will learn concepts and methods for identifying privacy leakages and creating technologies with provable guarantees of privacy protection. Covered topics include: privacy leakages & attacks (e.g., identifiability of data, record linkage, data profiling, data anonymity, de-identification), privacy-by-design, state-of-the-art privacy enhancing technologies (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity), and emerging privacy concepts (e.g. user behavioural privacy, usable privacy, privacy & AI, privacy regulation, and ethics).
