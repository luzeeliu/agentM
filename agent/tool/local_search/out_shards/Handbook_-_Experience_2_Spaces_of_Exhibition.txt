This intermediate course within the Experience disciplinary studio will explore the possibilities of exhibition spaces as active sites for participation and collaboration. Building on foundational knowledge and skills acquired in the introductory course, you will explore the cultures of display that influence exhibition practice. It investigates strategies employed by exhibition designers to frame objects and ideas in order to communicate their meaning to a diverse participating public. More than this, you will be encouraged as a designer to be an agent of change – provoking active engagement with collections and cultural spaces. The studio-based classes will explore ideas and theories for designing for museums and galleries. You will develop a creative inquiry-based around narrative composition and sequencing of spaces, and will learn about the integration of mediated experiences and technologies as an important element in contemporary exhibition practice. Adopting an iterative and collaborative methodology you will propose display strategies and prototype designs with consideration of different materials and constructions methods, that can ultimately reframe a visitor’s experience of ideas, objects and spaces.
