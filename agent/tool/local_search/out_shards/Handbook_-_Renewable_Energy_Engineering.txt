The specialisation in Renewable Energy Engineering develops skills for planning, design and operation of renewable energy systems and their integration into larger electricity systems. The degree covers a range of renewable energy technologies and systems, including utility-scale and distributed generation of electricity from photovoltaics, wind turbines; electricity and heat from solar thermal and biomass systems; supporting technologies including battery energy storage systems; and broader energy transition and sustainability topics such as energy efficiency, low energy buildings, life-cycle assessment, and electricity industry integration.
The cross-disciplinary nature of renewable energy engineering necessitates a range of core engineering skills and working in teams across disciplines, including electrical power systems, and data science. Data science skills are increasingly important in the industry and are developed across the four year degree. From Year 2, students can select a set of ‘Strand elective’ courses in one of three areas to develop interdisciplinary depth to their education in Renewable Energy. These strands are available in Humanitarian Engineering, Low Energy Systems, and Renewable Energy Systems. This structure offers a solid base of the core engineering knowledge, followed by secondary specialisation paths.
