This course gives students a statistical and mathematical perspective on modern machine learning methods, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of how such methods work and have been derived. This theoretical knowledge will then be used to demonstrate how to fine tune machine learning methods for complex applications. This course will focus on principles of neural networks (convolutional, recurrent, sequential methods), optimisation methods relevant for machine learning and generative AI (autoencoders, diffusion models, generative adversarial networks).
This course is intended as an elective for Statistics majors & minors, Quantitative Data Science Major and Mathematics majors, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.  Prior knowledge of basic probability is necessary, and knowledge of stochastic processes will be advantageous but is not required.  This course complements MATH5191 Optimisation for data science by focusing on various neural network architectures and training methods that make use of some optimisation methods explored in MATH5191, along with probabilistic aspects governing generative modelling.  Additionally, this course focuses on mathematical and statistical foundations of many machine learning methods discussed from a computational perspective in MATH5836.
This course is jointly taught at two levels.  MATH3881 is for 3rd year undergraduates, with MATH5881 for Honours & Masters students.
