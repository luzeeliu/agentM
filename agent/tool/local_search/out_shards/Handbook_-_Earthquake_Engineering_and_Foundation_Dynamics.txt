This is an advanced course in geotechnical earthquake engineering and engineering seismology.  It covers a wide range of topics to provide a background to most aspects of geotechnical earthquake engineering, allowing students to understand the theory and practice that underlie seismic design.
Engineering seismology, including earthquake generation and characterisation, wave propagation, strong ground motion and local site effects, is introduced as the basis of understanding earthquakes and their effects. The theory of deterministic and probabilistic seismic hazard assessments (SHAs) is then explained and the earthquake seismic hazard in Australia is discussed together with the Australian earthquake loading code AS1170.4.  .
Soil dynamics is introduced, explaining the theory of site response, soil liquefaction and ground vibrations. From this, ground motion characteristics such as response spectra and topographic amplification, can be understood. Discussion is also provided on associated site investigation and laboratory testing methods.
The engineering seismology and soil dynamics components of the course allow the understanding of how earthquake resistant engineering works can be developed.  The third part of the course goes into detail on the engineering design for projects including foundations, slopes, retaining walls and soil-structure interaction.  This includes details on the theory, design codes and standards, as well as undertaking designs in practice.
Extensive case histories are used throughout the course to help explain the theory and show its relevance.
