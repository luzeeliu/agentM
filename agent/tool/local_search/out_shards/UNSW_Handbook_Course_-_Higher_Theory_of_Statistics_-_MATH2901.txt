Description
As for MATH2801 but in greater depth:
This course provides an introduction to the theoretical underpinning of statistics; it covers fundamental results from probability and distribution theory and shows how to apply the theory to the analysis of data.  Topics include:  Random variables, univariate and bivariate distributions. Transformations of random variables.  Convergence of random variables, the sampling distribution and the Central Limit Theorem.  Estimation and inference including moment and likelihood estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing.
