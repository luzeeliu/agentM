Are you preparing for a career in medicine, allied health, biomedical research? Are you keen understand the structure of the human organ (viscera) systems through an exploration of cadaveric human donor material and medical imaging technology?  This course will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the functional and clinical anatomy of the viscera (organs) in the human body from both a topographical and systems perspective. The primary focus is on the organ systems of the trunk (respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, reproductive, lymphatic and autonomic nervous systems) and their functional integration with each other.  The course will enable you to build a 3-dimensional understanding of the human body and to apply this to cross-sectional and medical imaging, and to clinical anatomy. This course will prepare you for a career in medicine, allied health, biomedical research.
