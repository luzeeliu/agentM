This course focusses on the application of human factors in the context of transportation, and particularly transportation safety. It will consider the role that human factors play in normal operations, as well as in the tragedies that garner media attention. Most of the concepts discussed are applicable across transportation modes, and examples will be drawn from aviation, rail, maritime, road, and even space, transportation. The primary focus of the course is on commercial, rather than private, transportation.
