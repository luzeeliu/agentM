Accountability and responsibility are two of the key issues at the heart of every cultural transaction and exchange. Therefore a strong professional understanding of ethics and the law are essential for graduates aspiring to curatorial roles and cultural leadership.
This course is designed to examine the ethical and legal implications of interactions between artists, curators, exhibiting spaces and the public. It will enable the development of a broad critical perspective on the cultural, legal, political and moral contexts of mainstream and alternate cultural spaces. Issues discussed include theft and illegal export of cultural heritage items, curatorial conflicts, contracts, copyright, moral rights, art in public spaces, and censorship.
