There is an ever increasing demand in industry for graduates with technical expertise in Cyber Security. This stream will enable highly motivated students to gain this expertise, with an explicit engineering focus and an emphasis on security by design. The core courses teach secure coding and vulnerabilities, and examine failures, bugs and human/system interactions. Specialist electives allow students to focus on particular areas of interest. Graduates of this major will be well equipped for postgraduate research in security, or careers in penetration testing, incident response, software assessment, malware analysis, forensics, military or law enforcement, or security consulting.
