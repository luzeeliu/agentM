In this course you will elevate the study of food microbiology from its basic concepts to advanced consideration. The course will cover contemporary issues in microbial ecology of foods, food spoilage, foodborne microbial disease (including viruses), food and beverage fermentations, probiotic microorganisms, and the use of microorganisms as processing aids and sources of food ingredients and additives at an advanced level.
Using selected microbial groups and commodities, you will examine the biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms of microbial growth, survival and significance in food and beverage ecosystems as they evolve from raw material through processing to the consumer. These issues are directly related to the quality, safety, and production efficiency of food products. Through this course, you will gain an advantaged knowledge in these areas, and become more competent in managing microbiological issues in the food industry
