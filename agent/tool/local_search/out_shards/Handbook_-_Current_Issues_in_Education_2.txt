This course is part of the Education Professional Doctorate program. The purpose of this course is to provide you with an overview of questions of researcher positionality and the development of a background context in which your research is situated. The course will be conducted seminar style. It is designed to help you articulate your positionality in relation to your research topic and methodology; and to successfully locate academic literature related to questions of researcher standpoint, ethics, and reflexivity. The course also supports the development of the background to the study, in which you will identify and evaluate literature relevant to the issues in education you address in your developing thesis.
