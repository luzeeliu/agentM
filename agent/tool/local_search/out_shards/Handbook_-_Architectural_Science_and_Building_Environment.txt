Architectural Science and Building Environment focuses on applying the principles of acoustics, lighting and comfort to achieve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and enhanced environmental performance. The course contextualises the science of acoustics, lighting and comfort within architectural design with an emphasis on environmental data collection, analysis and application to optimise IEQ and environmental performance. You will explore the role of architectural design in mitigating indoor and outdoor thermal comfort impacts through real-world case-studies and online tools. You will investigate the significance of daylighting and artificial lighting design in IEQ and building environmental performance and apply acoustic principles to your studio designs. You will learn how to identify, evaluate and apply strategies to optimise acoustics, lighting and thermal comfort integrated with architectural design compliant with the regulatory standards applicable to environmental performance.
