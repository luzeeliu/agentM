BE Design Competitions
is one of four streams of the
Built Environment Interdisciplinary Learning (BEIL)
initiative offered by the Faculty of Built Environment.
The
BE Annual Design Competition
is an opportunity for BE students with at least 96UoC completed, to work on complex 'real life' projects in interdisciplinary teams with leading design professionals, industry and community partners. These competitions will offer an opportunity for students to learn from and interact with industry and community partners, and to showcase the resulting work via exhibition opportunities throughout the subsequent year.  The competition project will vary each year and may be taught by different undergraduate programs each year. The course will be taught in a studio style format, encouraging collaborative group work and group learning.
