This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Climate change, war, conflict, cyber-security, instability: these are but some of the security challenges facing individuals, governments, businesses, and international organisations in a rapidly changing and increasingly uncertain world. The minor in Security Studies will introduce you to the practice and study of security, equipping you with the skills needed to understand and address the security challenges facing the world today. You will explore a variety of security issues from a diverse range of perspectives, interrogating what security means, who it is for, how it is attained, and the power relationships and dynamics that underpin and inform these questions. Graduates with a minor in Security Studies are equipped with the skills and knowledge sought by a range of employers, including government departments such as Foreign Affairs and Trade, international organisations such as the United Nations, and businesses in a variety of sectors.
