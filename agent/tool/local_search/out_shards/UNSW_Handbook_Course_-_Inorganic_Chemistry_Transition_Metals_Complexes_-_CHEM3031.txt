Description
This course will provide you with an understanding of transition metal complexes, with a particular emphasis on recent developments and applications of these complexes in industry, in biology, and in research. In this course you will learn about: (a) How the structure and bonding within metal complex dictates its spectroscopic and magnetic properties; (b) The key mechanisms by which metal complexes react; (c) Organometallic chemistry and its importance in catalysis; (d) Bioinorganic chemistry – how transition metal chemistry is employed by living systems (in metalloenzymes).
