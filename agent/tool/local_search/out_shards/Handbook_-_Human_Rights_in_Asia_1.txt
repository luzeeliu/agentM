Human Rights in Asia examines issues relating to the recognition and enjoyment of human rights in selected Asia-Pacific countries. It explores the role international, regional and local organisations have played in embedding human rights norms in these nations, as well as critically interrogating claims of universality and Eurocentrism around human rights. The course will focus on the role of national human rights institutions in the protection of human rights in the region. Understanding the origins of these institutions and their mandates, functions and powers is becoming increasingly important for governments, legislators, bureaucrats, NGOs – and indeed anyone interested in promoting and protecting human rights.
Main Topics
The international standards governing National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)
The role of NHRIs in promoting and protecting human rights - from theory to practice; effective strategies; prevention and early intervention.
International monitoring mechanisms and their relationship to NHRIs; the effect of "globalisation".
The mandates, functions and powers of NHRIs-with specific attention to those in Australia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand - and references to those in Afghanistan, Jordan and Palestine.
The relationship between NHRIs and Government, Parliament, the Judiciary, other independent institutions, NGOs and civil society.
International and regional cooperation among NHRIs.
