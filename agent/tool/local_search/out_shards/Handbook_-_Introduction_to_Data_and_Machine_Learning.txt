A wide range of statistical methods and computational tools have been developed in the past few decades to gather information from data. This undergraduate course covers the key techniques in data mining and machine learning with theoretical background and applications, delivered through a series of lectures and tutorials. The topics include methods such as linear and logistic regression, neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, clustering and dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, and an introduction to deep learning. Emerging machine learning tools and libraries are used to illustrate the methods in programming environments that include Python and R.
