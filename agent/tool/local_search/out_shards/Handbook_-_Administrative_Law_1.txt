Administrative Law is a compulsory course that builds on what you will have already learnt in Principles of Public Law JURD7141 (Formerly Public Law JURD7140). The principles covered in this course themselves form the foundation for many other subjects, including Constitutional Law, Industrial Relations Law, Human Rights Law, Environmental Law and Migration/Refugee Law. The aim of the course is to ensure that students are familiar with the central principles of Administrative Law. Students completing the course will develop an appreciation of the relationship between law and government decision making, including how the law forms a framework that enables and controls government activity within the broader context of the rule of law. Students will learn the principles and procedures for review of administrative action, and learn to apply this understanding to resolve practical problems.
