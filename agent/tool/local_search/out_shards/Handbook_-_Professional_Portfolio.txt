Emerging technologies and digital disruption have dramatically transformed the types of work we do as well as the entire job application and interviewing process. In this hands-on course, you’ll use future-focused methods to find and land the jobs you want – even if these turn out to be roles that didn’t exist when you first started your degree. You’ll learn practical tips and tricks from industry insiders, hone your networking skills, produce a video pitch, and develop a polished and highly career-specific portfolio showcasing your work. You’ll also engage in rapid digital upskilling to help ensure your resume gets past the AI-powered recruitment robots that are the new normal in contemporary hiring. This course uses a bespoke approach which means you can use it to target any role in any organisation in any sector you like – including those outside Australia.
