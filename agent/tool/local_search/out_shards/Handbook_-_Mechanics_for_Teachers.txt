This is an online course covering mechanics. Lecture material and tutorial problems will be presented online. This is the second course in the graduate certificate for physics teachers. The course will cover classical Newtonian mechanics and special relativity. Classical mechanics is used to describe the motion of bodies under a system of forces. Special relativity is needed to describe the motion of bodies traveling with high speeds. Students will watch short video lectures online and solve problems related to the material. This course includes laboratory exercises that are completed at home and submitted online.
Assumed Knowledge:
Students need to be able to differentiate and integrate polynomials to complete this courses. A good understanding of HSC level extension 1 mathematics is recommended.
