This course is an introduction to sociological and anthropological perspectives on the nature of the social. You will consider questions such as: What is the social? What is the relation between the individual and society? How is the social lived and experienced? How do we understand the everyday? You will examine the social as idea, concept and experience through themes such as biography and selfhood, identity and difference, power and freedom, nature and culture, and state and nation. On completion of the course, you will have a general understanding of the key concepts underpinning sociological and anthropological perspectives on the study of social life. The course will provide many opportunities to reflect on the relevance of these themes for other disciplines of study.
