This course is available to students enrolled in an Honours Program in the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences (BABS). To be eligible, students must meet all requirements of stages 1 to 3 of their undergraduate degrees and have achieved an overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in level 3 Science courses. Enrolment must be approved by the School’s Honours Coordinator and requires the prior agreement of an approved BABS supervisor. Students enrolled in a non-Honours BSc program may also be admitted if they are eligible and an approved supervisor is available. The course is a 16 UOC Research Project in the School of BABS. Students will take this course in each of the three Terms over their Honours year - providing a total of 48 UOC. Across the three Terms, students undertake a full-time research project supervised by a BABS researcher or approved external supervisor in an affiliated institution.
Research in BABS is aligned with the discipline areas of Biotechnology, Genetics, Microbiology, Molecular and Cell Biology. Honours projects are developed in consultation with the supervisor and range from hypothesis driven “blue sky” research that advances human knowledge, to application-focused research that has potential medical and industrial benefits for society. By investigating and understanding life at the molecular and cellular level, students will therefore help solve real-world challenges.
