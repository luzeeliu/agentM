The recent surge in the volume of data collected owing to technological advances provides opportunities to improve processes and take better decisions across various industries. However, in order to turn large data sets into useful insights, combining the knowledge of right data with right analytical tools is important. Data-driven decision making is an industry-oriented course where students learn data management and analytic skills through a major project and real case studies from the School’s research strengths/industrial experience in chemical engineering and food science.
In this course, you will discover advanced methods for obtaining, handling and summarising various categories of data with databases. The course will also focus on how to analyse the collected data efficiently by applying sophisticated analytical techniques including statistical tests, inferences and regression analysis.
A working knowledge of introductory statistics and introductory programming is assumed.
