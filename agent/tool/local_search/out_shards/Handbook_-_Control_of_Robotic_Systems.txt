This course provides a mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robotic systems including robot manipulators, mobile ground robots and quadrotors. By the end of the course, students are expected to learn the fundamental concepts and core principles of nonlinear control theory and Lyapunov stability, adaptive control and robust control, and are expected to learn how to control the motion of different robotic systems such as rigid manipulators, unicycle robots and quadrotors using nonlinear controllers. The course projects require students to use simulation software and control theory to model and control different robotic systems.
