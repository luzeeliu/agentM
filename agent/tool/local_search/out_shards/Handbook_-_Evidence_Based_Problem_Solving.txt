Effective problem solving is a core capability of a successful business professional, and UNSW Business School students need to demonstrate problem solving initiative and confidence in their studies and professional careers. DPBS1110 introduces students to the fundamentals of a deliberate and structured approach to problem solving, balancing analysis and judgement, to avoid the common pitfalls of problem solving in organisations. The importance and power of evidence, and familiarity with the different sources of evidence, are critical for identifying, solving and communicating a problem.
Starting from business problems that organisations are confronted with, students will develop their ethical judgement, reasoning and analysis skills and work with both quantitative and qualitative data as a preparation for critical interpretation of data. In addition to developing an analytical mindset and new ways of working with data, students are also introduced to the basic statistical skills required for working with small data sets. This course is a fully problem-based learning course that starts with a multi-faceted problem.
Link to other courses: DPBS1110 is a prerequisite for Data, Insights and Decisions (DPBS1190). It is recommended to be taken early in first year as structured problem-solving skills, working with big data sets and mastering common analytics tools are universally useful.
Additional: Students might also find it helpful to access the Career Accelerator’s Case Coach online tool to complement their learning.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
