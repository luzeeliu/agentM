Description
Comparative biogeography studies the patterns that explain how life and Earth evolve together. In order to make sense of these patterns, this course introduces you to biological classification, evolution and deep time, which allows you to discover the processes that have shaped the distribution of life on Earth. The course, assessed on practical assignments, is aimed at students interested in palaeoecology, phylogenetics, terrestrial and marine biogeography and related professions.
