Airline Management is a vast topic – few people can become subject matter experts across the broad spectrum that encompasses airline management in its entirety within a lifetime. This is also the case in teaching such a subject over a 10 week term. With an array of possible subject matter, this course has as its focus, the main facets of corporate airline management and begins with airline organisational practice, management's visions and objective setting. It proceeds with the main corporate processes of business planning, network and fleet planning, schedule planning, revenue management and consideration of key external factors, such as the prevailing regulatory environment. Financial analysis, performance benchmarking and business model options are also addressed
The course is uniquely structured and delivered in such a way to allow students to be exposed to a diverse range of industry subject matter experts, through the inclusion of guest speakers on a week-to-week basis during the scheduled lecture time. These guest lecturers are currently working in industry and in various locations nationally and internationally. In order to allow for these guest speakers to share their knowledge in real time with the students, lectures are delivered online. During these lectures, students also have the opportunity to directly engage with these industry experts, which in itself, differs from some other subjects offered in the school.
Another unique component of the course, is the airline simulation tool provided by SIMULATE.AERO, which is a software program that will involve students running and managing their own startup airline over the course of the term. The simulation will form the basis of one of the assessments, which students will work on during the weekly tutorials. As with the guest speakers, we will work closely with the software provider and for this reason, tutorials will be a combination of online instruction, as well as person participation and held in the allocated classroom.
