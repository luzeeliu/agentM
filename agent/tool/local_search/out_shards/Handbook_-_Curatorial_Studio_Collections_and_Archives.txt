The history of curatorial practice is entangled with the human desire to collect, organise, and display objects. This curatorial studio explores the reconfiguration, reinterpretation, and re-imagination of culturally significant collections and archives in contemporary curatorial practice. It explores the relationships between cultural objects (including artworks), exhibitions, and audiences with reference to key theoretical and historical frameworks informing contemporary curatorial and artistic interventions into cultural collections and archives. Through a series of case studies, field trips, guest presentations and structured learning activities, you will develop practical skills and knowledge relevant to professional contexts, as well as conceptual and analytical skills to critically engage with this multifaceted field of practice. In doing so, this curatorial studio enables you to develop critically informed and innovative approaches, leading to collaborative curatorial projects that engage directly with real-world collections and archives.
