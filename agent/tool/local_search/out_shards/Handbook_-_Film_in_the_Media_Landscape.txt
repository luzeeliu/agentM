Film’s place in the media landscape has transformed over time, as new technologies and viewing habits take hold. This course examines the ways that film has responded to and archived its interactions with other mechanical and electronic media (including radio, TV, the turntable, the telephone, and digital capture and synthesis). By examining the history of media convergences, you will understand "new" media in a broader historical framework. You will examine how individual films, genres, and formations of cinema have addressed residual, emergent, and dominant media through their formal and stylistic elements, thematic concerns, and exhibition practices.
