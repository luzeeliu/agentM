This course will help you understand the core concepts behind measuring and abating carbon emissions in order to achieve the science-based targets and Net Zero emissions by 2050.
Clean energy will need to replace fossil fuels before 2050. McKinsey (2022) estimates this will cost an additional $3.5 trillion a year - the largest reallocation of capital in history - and will affect every country and every sector of the economy. The enormity and complexity of this challenge is creating strong and rapidly growing demand for leaders in every industry who understand the principles of decarbonisation and how an organisation can develop a realistic pathway to achieve Net Zero emissions. Regardless of the industry in which you are working, or your role in that industry, this course will help you to become a more valuable leader for your organisation and for society.
This course incorporates a Net Positive approach to decarbonisation, identifying the unprecedented opportunities for organisations and professionals to create value in a just transition to a decarbonised economy. The scale of these opportunities is evident in New South Wales, where the formal announcement of a Renewable Energy Zone in the Hunter Valley and Central Coast Region in 2022 attracted more than $100 billion worth of proposed projects.
