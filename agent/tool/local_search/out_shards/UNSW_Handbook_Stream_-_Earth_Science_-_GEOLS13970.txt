Stream Outline
Earth Scientists study the nature and evolution of the structure of our planet, covering everything from natural crystals and fossils to the powerful forces that drive earthquakes and volcanoes and move continents across the globe. Almost everything we do involves the Earth in some way. Tuition covers environmental geology, geochemistry, geophysics, hydrogeology and groundwater contamination, mineral and petroleum exploration and resources, palaeontology, remote sensing and much more. Field work in different regions of New South Wales is an essential part of geology courses.
