Climate change is an existential crisis. But what is existence, climate, and the Earth, and how do we perceive them changing? This course on climate and the media begins with the material foundations of life and communication in the Universe. You will examine the elements, forces, and technologies that enable us to live and perceive the climate around us. You will explore how climate change is mediated by science, sensors, computers, and satellites–and often denied by the fossil fuel industries. Through case studies and practical exercises, you will investigate the media activism, Indigenous approaches, renewable energy proposals, and geoengineering that are presented as solutions. Situating life at the planetary scale, we will collectively grapple with the fundamental reality that no matter what we do to address climate change, the Earth and our solar system will end anyway. In doing so, we will consider what it means to live in kinship with other organisms on a hotter and drier world–or become a multiplanetary species.
