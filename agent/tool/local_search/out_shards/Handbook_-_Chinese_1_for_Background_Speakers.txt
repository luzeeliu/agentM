This introductory Chinese course is for Chinese background speakers who recognise fewer than 50 Chinese characters. Starting from Pinyin, the official phonetic system of Standard Chinese, the course helps you establish a systematic learning pattern and develops your four language skills (i.e. listening, speaking, reading and writing) in an integrated manner. It introduces you approximately 150 vocabulary words, along with the associated sociocultural and linguistic awareness in day-to-day topics, such as greetings, introducing oneself, making an appointment and talking about university life.
All students must fill in the placement questionnaire available at https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/students/courses/language-placements. This will help the Course Convenors make sure you are taking the appropriate level of Chinese 1 (for background or non-background speakers). You may be requested to change your enrolment.
