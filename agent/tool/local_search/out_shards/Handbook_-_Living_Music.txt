This course is about live performance, and the course's assessment is based on your attendance of musical events. By documenting performances of different genres of music, and participating in discursive lectures and tutorials, you will learn to respond critically to live music. In the course you will frame your responses through the diverse features of music culture and industry, including repertoires, ensembles, rehearsals, real and virtual architectures, marketing, and audiences and their behaviours. You will also develop skills of ethnographic data collection, attending performances across Sydney. The course is designed for everyone who loves live performance, including musicians who are developing their own musical practice.
