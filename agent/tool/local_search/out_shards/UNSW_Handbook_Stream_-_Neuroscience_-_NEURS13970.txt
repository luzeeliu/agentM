Stream Outline
Neuroscience introduces students to the biological and behavioural aspects of the nervous system, and is based around the neuroscience courses offered by the departments of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology, and School of Psychology.
Stream Structure
Important:
when planning to take this major, students should choose their courses carefully as some electives are prerequisites for courses in Stage 2 and 3. In particular, students should check the prerequisites for PHAR2011, ANAT3411, PSYC2001 and PHAR3202.
