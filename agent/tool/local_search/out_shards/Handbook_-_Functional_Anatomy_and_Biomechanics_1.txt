Are you preparing to be a movement specialist, or seeking a deeper understanding of function and dysfunction of the body?  Immerse yourself in understanding functional anatomy of movement underpinned by foundational principles of biomechanics. In this course you will acquire a deep understanding of the neuromuscular anatomy of the body and its role in facilitating movement by integrating functional biomechanics. You will apply this knowledge to understand how movement may be compromised in musculoskeletal and nerve injury. Hands-on laboratory-based study involving human donor cadavers, medical imaging and surface anatomy will be complemented by adaptive online learning modules and case-based tutorials to understand normal function, clinical presentation and functional deficits.
