The course will synthesise your learning across the degree to emphasis the range of advanced micro to macro social work skills that are required across diverse and complex contexts of practice. Case studies from humanitarian emergencies and disasters will be used to explore and develop social work skills, knowledges, and practices. The skills, knowledges, and practices gained in the course will be transferable to a wide range of practice contexts.
The course will be underpinned by critical theoretical and practice frameworks including anti-oppressive, intersectional, rights and strength-based approaches to vulnerability, grief, trauma, and resilience.  It will draw on the important contributions of diverse cultural knowledges, connection with the environment and First Nation knowledges. It will extend your counselling, community and social development skills and responses and contribute to developing your personal practice framework.
