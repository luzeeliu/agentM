Your final placement allows you to apply theoretical and skills based learning in a practice setting. You will be linked with a qualified social worker in a human services agency offering practice based learning, in accordance with the AASW Practice Standards. This learning experience is supported by social work supervision promoting critical reflection; it will guide you through a developmental process focusing on knowledge, skills and values relevant to the social work profession. You are consulted about your placement allocation so your learning goals and professional interests are given close consideration. Placements occur in diverse contexts of practice such as hospitals, state and federal government departments, and non-government community based organisations. Social work interventions may include policy, research, counselling, case work and community work. You will develop general social work skills, transferable to all social work contexts. The first part of placement comprises 23 attendance days (159 hours) and is generally undertaken four days per week from mid Term 2. The placement is accompanied by a series of Integration Seminars that support and complement your field based learning, with an emphasis on theory-practice integration, critical social work and critical reflection. This course is Part A of your second Field Education placement which continues into Term 3 at the same agency in the course Social Work Practice Level 4 Placement B, at the end of which grading is finalized for both courses.
