The KLC component of Lawyers and Society fits with your other law courses in that it demonstrates law in practice and the specific ways in which it impacts on disadvantaged clients. Law is a subjective, constantly changing area and this course will give you the opportunity to explore some of the ways in which law is used in the legal aid system to assist people who are disadvantaged.
The Legal Ethics component of Lawyers and Society complements the KLC component of Lawyers and Society by providing some theoretical background to many of the ethical issues you could encounter as a practising lawyer. It also provides an introduction to the Bachelor of Laws core course LAWS1230 – Lawyers, Ethics and Justice.
Main Topics
The aims of the KLC component of Lawyers and Society are to:-
encourage students to keep studying law
allow students to see law in practice to make their studies relevant
allow students to bond with each other
allow students to see how the law affects/can help disadvantaged people
develop written and oral communication skills
develop knowledge of law
develop ability to critically examine the law and its effects
make students law studies relevant to their lives through clinical work
provide additional support for students
This is achieved through a combination of approaches.  You will be introduced to an overview of the legal aid system through visits to: the Local court, pro bono section of a commercial law firm, Legal Aid Commission and the Public Defender’s Office. You will also be taught a concentrated course on interviewing skills as they relate to disadvantaged clients.  You will interview real clients in order to improve your oral and written communication skills.  You will also have the opportunity to work with later year law students learning about legal file work.
The aims of the Legal Ethics component of Lawyers and Society are to:-
develop written and oral communication skills
develop legal problem-solving skills
gain an overview of the legal profession in Australia
understand what sort of work lawyers, barristers and judges do
begin to appreciate the ethical responsibilities that legal practitioners have to clients, to the court and to society more broadly
understand access to justice issues
understand how the legal profession in Australia is regulated, especially with reference to professional discipline and costs
These aims are achieved through intensive, small group discussions; considering practical applications of Legal Ethics component aims and opportunities for directed feedback.
