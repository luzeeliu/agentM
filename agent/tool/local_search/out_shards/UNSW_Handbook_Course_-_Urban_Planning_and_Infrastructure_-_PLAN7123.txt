Description
The objective of this course is to examine the policy context and practical aspects of the planning, funding, provision, and maintenance of urban infrastructure.  Models of infrastructure financing and provision are examined, long with the role of the private sector.  Infrastructure needs of modern cities, and the role of planning and planners in meeting those needs, are examined.  Urban management and governance structures to provide urban infrastructure, along with methods for assessing the feasibility of major projects, are considered.
