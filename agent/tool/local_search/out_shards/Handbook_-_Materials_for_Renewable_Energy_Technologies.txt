This Level 4 elective course in materials science and engineering introduces students to the materials used in devices for production and storage of sustainable and renewable energy. The course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions about selecting and using a particular material and processing route for a given energy component or device.
The course focuses on the technologies and materials used in solar, wind, nuclear and hydrogen power use and storage. Students will learn the materials requirements in relation to application demands for technologies used to generate energy from sustainable sources, including batteries, supercapacitors and clean chemical fuels. Through group activities and critical thinking exercises, students will understand how to evaluate and select optimal materials and processes for specific energy applications, based on consideration of their complex property profile requirements. Real-world examples and case studies will be used to illustrate the concepts covered in the course. Additionally, guest speakers from relevant industries and research fields will be invited to provide contextual insights and perspectives.
The course includes lectures, group project work and presentations, reports, quizzes and a final exam.
Previous knowledge of chemistry, physics and physical properties of materials is recommended.
