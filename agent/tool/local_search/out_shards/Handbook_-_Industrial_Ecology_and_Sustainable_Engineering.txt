Sustainability means living well within the limits of a finite planet. More than ever, engineers need to find holistic and effective solutions to currently unsustainable practices of production and consumption, to protect our vital life support systems and meet the social and economic needs of a growing human population at the same time.
This course teaches concepts and methods to analyse and assess the environmental impacts of industrial systems and economies. It aims to equip students with the ability to understand challenges of sustainability from a local to global scale, to think critically, holistically and with a life cycle perspective and to apply sustainability assessment methods and tools (such as input-output analysis, hybrid life cycle assessment and environmental footprint assessment) in real-world examples.
