Businesses are navigating through challenging global uncertainties (e.g. pandemic, war, climate changes) worldwide. IS/IT is an indispensable part of all business operations today; however even the most advanced technologies still cannot avoid the risks and vulnerabilities faced by organisations. IS/IT provides means by which organisations process their transactions, the mechanisms by which business stakeholders communicate, and the performance and productivity tools in which information is created, managed and maintained in order to pursue the visions and strategies of organisations. The problem is exacerbated by cyber adversaries keeping pace with global uncertainties with many adapting to a changing target landscape.
This course addresses knowledge and leadership in planning and managing IS/IT risks in organisations, in the face of the current cybersecurity landscape. This course further investigates these risks in a systematic manner and looks at the current theory, methods and best practice for their identification, assessment, analysis and mitigation.
