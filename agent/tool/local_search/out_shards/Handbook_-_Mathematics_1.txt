Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.
You are responsible for ensuring that you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and by following the advice of your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program requirements.
Additional Information
Notes
Students majoring in Mathematics are strongly recommended to take MATH2301 or an equivalent course in practical numerical computing.
Many courses in Mathematics are offered at two levels. The higher level courses cater for students with greater mathematical ability and/or a higher level of prior knowledge. Students with suitable qualifications are encouraged to enrol in the corresponding higher level courses.
Students who are completing the Bachelor Science (majoring in Mathematics) in concurrent mode with a Bachelor of Engineering will need to substitute some level II courses in the Engineering program. For more information see this document:
Mathematics in BE BSc Programs
or contact the
School of Mathematics and Statistics
.
Honours
Students interested in undertaking Honours in Applied or Pure Mathematics must take at least 30 UoC of Stage III Applied or Pure Mathematics courses in order to be eligible. Please consult the School of Mathematics and Statistics for advice on choosing the right courses.
