The Mechanical Engineering stream provides a versatile, comprehensive coverage of areas involving the conception and design of machinery and mechanical plant, the supervision of its construction, operation and maintenance, the planning and supervision of large engineering projects, and general engineering management. Due to its wide range, a number of options are provided as Technical Elective courses in the final year. These are preferentially linked to provide a direction appropriate to the needs of Australian industry and to the specific interests of students, although some flexibility is available if required. Typical fields which may be encompassed by the program include building services, computer-aided design, power generation, energy and environmental systems, gas and liquid handling, bio-mechanics, materials handling, control systems and transport. An emphasis is placed on the application of engineering science, development and management in these fields.

Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.
You are responsible for ensuring that you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and by following the advice of your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program requirements.
Additional Information
Thesis Arrangements
Students complete a sequence of thesis courses (MMAN4951, MMAN4952 and MMAN4953) in consecutive terms in the final year of their candidature.
These enrolments represent a single thesis project that is developed and completed over the duration of the full set of thesis courses. On conclusion of the last thesis course a final overall mark is added to all thesis courses.
Under exceptional circumstances and with School permission, students may apply to enrol in MMAN4952 and MMAN4953 concurrently.
Students in the BE(Hons)/BiomedE program must complete the following Biomedical Engineering Thesis courses in place of the thesis courses offered their BE (Hons) specialisations: BIOM4951, BIOM4952 and BIOM4953.
Students who fail thesis may have to repeat, restart or change thesis projects depending on the circumstances. Please see
