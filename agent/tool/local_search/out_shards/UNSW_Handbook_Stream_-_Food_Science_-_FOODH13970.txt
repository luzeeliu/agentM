Stream Outline
Food Science involves the understanding of basic sciences and the application of this knowledge from paddock to plate. It involves the study of production, handling, processing, preservation, distribution and marketing,  through to consumption and utilisation by consumers.
Food Science is concerned with food processes, food commodities, food composition and food quality (including sensory properties, safety and nutritional value).
