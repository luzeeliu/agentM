This program is for students commencing from 2023.
The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) is designed for aspiring students in creative fields who are open minded, curious, and inventive, and who wish to immerse themselves in their creative practice. The three-year (full-time equivalent) BFA is home to distinctive specialisations in Animation and Moving Image, Art Theory, Music, and Visual Arts, each of which is led by experts in your field and supported by specialist facilities. The BFA’s focus on practical and hands-on learning is complemented by studies in the histories and theories of your discipline, helping you to become highly attuned to the ways that creativity and culture intersect with the social, ethical, and global contexts of our times. In the BFA, you will join a diverse creative community that fosters deep engagement in creative practice, enabling you to explore and express the ideas and questions that are meaningful and important to you in a supportive and rigorous environment. By honing your creative and professional practice skills throughout the degree, the BFA prepares you to take the next steps in your creative future through industry pathways and opportunities for further studies.
The Animation and Moving Image, Art Theory, and Visual Arts specialisations are taught at the Paddington Campus. The Music, Music Creative Practice, Music Pedagogy, and Music Sonic Arts specialisations are taught at the Kensington Campus.
