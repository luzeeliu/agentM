Australia finds itself in a rapidly changing and uncertain international environment, presenting foreign policymakers with a number of key issues, challenges, and risks to address. In this course, you will consider some of the main themes and issues in contemporary Australian foreign policy. The course begins with an exploration of the foundations of Australia’s foreign relations, including the formulation and implementation of foreign policy, national identity, and the extent to which Australia can be described as a ‘Middle Power’. You will then look at some of the key issues in Australian foreign policy. These include Australia’s evolving relationships with traditional allies, its management of relations with rising powers, national security, immigration, and Australia’s participation in the global economy.
