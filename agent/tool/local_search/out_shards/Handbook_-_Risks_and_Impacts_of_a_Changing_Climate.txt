As global temperatures near 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and track towards 2°C, broad sectors across government, non-government and industry must consider and plan for climate change impacts.
This course will present the essentials of understanding and managing climate risk. Material will be presented in a manner that is accessible to students from all backgrounds and disciplines, demonstrating how climate risk may manifest as a challenge in a wide range of sectors (e.g., built environment, engineering, business, health, law, economics and policy). We aim to provide a fundamental understanding that will inform students within their own speciality and to engage them in an emerging issue that will be critical to their long-term employability in business, industry or government.
The course material is presented entirely online giving you flexibility in when to engage with the course (noting deadlines for assessment tasks). There are also online practicals which provide experience dealing with climate projection data to answer questions about future risk.
