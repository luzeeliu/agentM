This course will cover the pathogenic mechanisms used by a diverse array of bacterial pathogens to cause human disease and the epidemiology and strategies used to control and prevent these infectious diseases. The course provides students with a high level of understanding of how bacteria cause disease and practical skills in the identification of bacterial pathogens.  The lecture program includes key pathogens infecting different body systems and current research on selected bacterial pathogens.  In conjunction with the lecture program, the laboratory program offers practical experiences in contemporary medical microbiology techniques used for the diagnosis of bacterial infections. In addition, students will develop their research skills by conducting a research project on the isolation and characterisation of a common bacterial pathogen using conventional and molecular techniques.
