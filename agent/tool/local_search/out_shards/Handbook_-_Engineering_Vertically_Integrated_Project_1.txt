This course is designed for highly motivated undergraduates seeking the opportunity to integrate specific curricular and co-curricular components into their undergraduate program, to provide them with enhanced preparation and experience in the areas of Leadership and Project Management as it relates to engineering research and/or design, and thus giving them a headstart when seeking employment.
The courses run across three consecutive terms within a single calendar year: T1, 2 and 3 (2 UoC per Term) for a total of 6 UoC at the end, which enables students to extend their project-based learning experience beyond a single term.
You must complete all three terms of the course and satisfy all assessment requirements as set out by the course coordinator to receive full course credit. Partial credits will not be given.
Students will pursue research or project execution in a particular theme, explore interdisciplinary course-work, gain a global perspective, develop an entrepreneurial mindset, or give back to the community through service learning. Benefits for participating can include unique opportunities and experiences, mentoring by academic supervisors, guest speakers, and funding opportunities and engagement with industry partners.
Under the guidance of academic mentors and industry mentors, this course provides a vehicle for guided but independent group project work on varying briefs. The learning and effort in the course is largely team-based, with team-members ideally being drawn from different discipline areas. Students will develop their skills in critical thinking, problem definition, creative and systematic design, precise written and oral technical communication skills, and professional skills including communication and team organisation and coordination. The course allows students to design, build and research a variety of projects.
ENGG2600 is the first course in a "vertical" sequence of project-based learning courses, with ENGG3600 and ENGG4600 also offered, and thereby allows students an opportunity to engage again at a more senior level and attain more advanced skills.
Prerequisite conditions:
UNSW Engineering students: (Successful completion of DESN1000 or enrolled in a Food Science or Computer Science plan) AND successful completion of at least 42 UOC AND enrolled in a program offered by the Faculty of Engineering.
UNSW Medicine students (program 3805 or 3856) must have demonstrated adequate performance with teamwork in every course during their first year to be eligible to participate in Vertically Integrated Courses: ENGG2600, ENGG3600, ENGG4600.
Medicine students must also be eligible to overload during year 3 based on the general education requirements for BSc (Med) Hons.
Students from other UNSW Faculties may apply to join the ChallENG program as a General Education elective. Students should ensure their program requires a General Education elective prior to application.
Note: WAM will be considered in all student applications for enrolment in this course.
