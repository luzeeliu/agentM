The aviation industry is highly dynamic and is mostly regulated through policy decided by national governments. This Aviation Policy course outlines the various dynamics influencing aviation policy and its creation processes. More importantly, it also addresses how to change and influence the policy environment, drawing on Australian and international aviation examples.
This fully online, distance learning course explores the various stakeholders that influence international (and domestic) aviation policy. The course then explores various areas of aviation associated with key policy decisions – airlines, airports, uncrewed aviation, air traffic control. The course draws on case-based learning and includes assessments that integrate aviation policy scenarios, to illustrate the processes and stakeholders involved, and provide guidance on how to design policy for good outcomes.
