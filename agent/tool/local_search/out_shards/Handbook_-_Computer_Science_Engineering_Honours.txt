The Bachelor of Science (Honours) program in Computer Science and Engineering is a 1-year full-time or 2-year part-time award undertaken by eligible students after completion of a 3-year Bachelor of Science program in a relevant discipline and offers students an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the discipline through the completion of advanced coursework and a research thesis.
The goals of the program are to:
Provide advanced training to enable graduates to competently undertake sophisticated computing tasks in industry and commerce.
Provide investigative academic training in preparation for undertaking postgraduate research, through Masters and PhD programs.
In attaining these goals, the following objectives are considered important:
To expand the scope and depth of training, by coursework, in chosen areas.
To foster the development of personal initiative and group interaction by encouraging individual and cooperative investigation of topics of interest.
To foster the development of creativity and project management by the planning and undertaking of significant project work in the form of a research thesis.
To promote the development of verbal and written presentation skills.
