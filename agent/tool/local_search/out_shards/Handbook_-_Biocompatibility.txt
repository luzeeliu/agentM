Biocompatibility is a fascinating field that explores the interaction between biomaterials, medical devices, and living tissues. In this course, you’ll explore medical devices, biomaterials, and tissue engineering, learning the essentials of designing biocompatible medical devices.
Through a blend of lectures, hands-on activities, and self-guided tasks, you’ll navigate the landscape of biomaterials and anticipate their behaviour in biological systems. You’ll gain knowledge about the application of biomaterials in various medical devices such as breast implants, vascular stents, hernia meshes and hip implants. The core principles of tissue engineering will be discussed, empowering you to apply these concepts in creating innovative medical device designs.
The course will shed light on how the processing, sterilisation, and handling of materials can influence the functionality of medical devices. You’ll gain insights into the assessment of biocompatibility for regulatory approval of medical devices, a crucial process that ensures a medical device does not produce an unacceptable adverse biological response, such as toxicity, skin irritation, or systemic effects like cancer or developmental anomalies. The course will also guide you through the body’s responses to biomaterials, enabling you to predict reactions to new device designs and critically evaluate current biocompatibility testing protocols.
Engaging you with real-world case studies, this course will foster problem-solving skills and creativity in the field of biocompatibility. By the end of this journey, you’ll have gained a solid foundation of knowledge, practical skills, and a growing interest in the dynamic field of biomedical engineering. This course will empower you to apply these learnings to real-world challenges, contributing to the development of safer and more effective medical devices.
