This course investigates in real time how can businesses can create real social and environmental impact while generating economic value.
In COMM5030 Social Entrepreneurship Practicum, you will work with a mission driven business to tackle a real-world problem. Whether it’s improving business operation practices, understanding competition and consumers, measuring impact, securing investment, or creating opportunities for marginalized communities or environmental protection, you’ll help design solutions that matter. This is a hands-on class working with real clients, exploring the challenges of social entrepreneurship.
This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply their cumulative learning and build practical business and leadership capabilities within a social entrepreneurship context. The course is taught through student engagement with a social entrepreneurship project, supported by both online modules and face-to-face workshops.
Each practicum experience will be different depending on the particular client project on which each student will work. Assessment tasks are designed to provide a consulting style framework to both create value for the social entrepreneurship project, and to enable students to demonstrate their ability to apply and synthesise social entrepreneurship concepts.
The course is the capstone course for the Master of Commerce Global Sustainability and Social Impact specialisation. It is also an alternative capstone practicum course for other MCom and MCom (Ext) specialisations. This course may also be taken as a free elective in other Master of Commerce and Master of Commerce (Ext) specialisations and as an elective in the Master of Professional Accounting (Ext) program. Please refer to the specialisation Handbook entries.
The course is offered in Terms 1, 2 and 3.
