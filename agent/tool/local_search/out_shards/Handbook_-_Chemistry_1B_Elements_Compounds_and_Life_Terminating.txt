CHEM1521 covers a range of fundamental concepts that can be used to explain phenomena in chemistry as well as the biological, medicinal, and material sciences. Students who have completed CHEM1A previously will build on their skills to explore topics such as kinetics, structure determination, stereochemistry, transition metal chemistry, and the study of organic chemical reactions and mechanisms. The course concludes with a capstone exploration of molecular machines, which encompasses all topics explored in Chemistry 1A and Chemistry 1B.
Students will engage with weekly digital lessons that introduce content which is extended in online lectures, problem solving workshops and tutorials. The weekly online laboratory class gives students experience in placing course theory into a practical laboratory context. Course runs on request, contact school for more information.
