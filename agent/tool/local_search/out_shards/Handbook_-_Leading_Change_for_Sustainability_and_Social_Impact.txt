Leading Change for Sustainability and Social Impact is a course designed for future leaders who are passionate about creating positive social and environmental change.
Your ideas and passion for sustainability and social impact are just the first step to professional success. You need skills in leadership, creativity, systems thinking, communication and models for cultural change so that you can influence key decision-makers, build networks and make your idea a reality.
The challenges of sustainability and social impact are driving change in many organisation, from large foundations to social enterprises, not-for-profits working with government to provide services, and small to large businesses. This course explores how to create and implement sustainability and social impact strategies for different organisational types. We take a broad view of sustainability based on the Sustainable Development Goals, acknowledging the human, social, economic and environmental elements of positive cultural change. We examine complex aspects of sustainability and social impact leadership faced by leaders from business, government and civil society.
