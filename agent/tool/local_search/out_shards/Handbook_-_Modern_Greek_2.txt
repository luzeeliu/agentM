This course is a continuation of Introductory Greek A which is a pre-requisite, unless you who have otherwise acquired a basic knowledge of reading, writing and speaking Greek. It provides an introductory to intermediate level program in Greek language study and culture. Basic grammatical and syntactical aspects of Greek are further examined through oral, listening and reading activities. The morphology and structure of the language are presented in the context of culturally relevant topics which concern the modern Greek world. These are also presented in English. As for Introductory Greek A, topics explored include aspects of popular culture and current affairs. These topics will be explored in greater detail than in Introductory Greek A.
Through the study of the language and culture you will further develop an informed understanding of Greek experiences, cultures in general, societies and world views. You will have the opportunity to further develop linguistic tools to be able to acquire more detailed communicative skills in Greek on everyday topics; to further develop your awareness of cultural and cross-cultural issues; and to become more efficient language learners.
