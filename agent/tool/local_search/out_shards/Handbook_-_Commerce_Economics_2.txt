The
Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Economics (BCom/BEc)
combines the professional orientation of the Bachelor of Economics program with the range of majors available through the Bachelor of Commerce program.
This combination allows students to gain greater depth and breadth in their business education than is possible in a single degree, providing students with the opportunity to complete majors in up to three business disciplines during their 4 years.
Students will complete a major in both a selected area of Commerce and the professional discipline of Economics. With approval, students with an appropriate academic record may also enrol in an additional Honours year in the relevant program offered in either the Commerce or Economics component of the combined degree.
