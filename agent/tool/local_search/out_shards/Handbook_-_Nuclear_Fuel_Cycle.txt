This course provides students with an in-depth, practical knowledge of the nuclear fuel cycle from the metallurgy of Uranium to the disposition of spent reactor fuel. The course will explore current and future reactor designs, their life cycle, waste management and decommission. Emphasis is placed on the latest advancements in nuclear research that have the potential to transform the fuel cycle. Students will learn from UNSW academics, as well as ANSTO staff who will provide an industry perspective on the fuel cycle. For each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, students will be encouraged to critique existing technologies and suggest ways to optimize established processes. Students taking this course are expected to be conversant in nuclear engineering and have the skills to engage in self-directed reading, learning, research, and communication in nuclear engineering systems.
