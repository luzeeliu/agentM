Do you want to lead change and implement social innovations? Would you like to find ways to address complex social problems?
This course is for aspiring change agents across all sectors, including business, not-for-profit and government. You will develop practical skills to lead complex systems to create better social outcomes. We explore the issues that policymakers, industry leaders and social service providers grapple with every day, such as inequality, place-based disadvantage, mental health, homelessness, and human rights. We will introduce models for systems change, and social innovation.
The course will equip you with a broad understanding of social systems and the keys to initiating and sustaining positive social change. Through a range of local and global case studies, you will acquire the skills to identify and analyse stakeholders and structural elements in the social challenges that shape society.
Join us to become a catalyst for change and make a tangible impact on society!
