Prepare for a career in one of the world’s most advanced engineering fields with a nuclear specialisation that prioritises safety, security, and sustainability. This program provides a strong understanding of the physics within a reactor, radiation interactions with matter, and the cradle-to-grave of nuclear fuel cycles. This will equip you with the knowledge to support the safe and responsible use of nuclear technology.
You will explore how nuclear systems operate, learning about reactor design, fuel cycles, and regulatory frameworks. Practical applications are emphasised through case studies, problem-solving exercises, and industry-aligned projects that develop your technical and analytical skills.
This specialisation is ideal for engineers seeking opportunities in nuclear power, defence, medical applications, research or regulation. You will gain an understanding of the unique risks and safeguards required in the nuclear sector, ensuring you can contribute to safe and effective operations.
If you are interested in cutting-edge technology and its real-world applications, this program will provide the skills and knowledge to begin your journey in nuclear engineering.

Course Substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering. Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superseded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
