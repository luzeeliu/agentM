Today's organisations operate on a global scale and collect huge volumes of data from multiple sources. Management recognises the need to learn how to gather and manage data, transform it into new insights, and translate those insights into effective front-line and strategic actions in order to have a better understanding of business performance and gain competitive advantage.
This course will provide you with advanced business analytics methods for Predictive Analytics.
The methodologies related to Predictive Analytics are classified into Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. While our main focus is on employing supervised and reinforcement learning methods for predictive analytics projects, analysts may also utilize unsupervised learning techniques during a predictive analytics project to gain better understanding of the data and accelerate the predictive modelling process.
You will implement these methodologies using Python, which is widely used thanks to its large toolkit in data processing and analysis. Business case studies will be introduced alongside the technical aspects of Python coding.
