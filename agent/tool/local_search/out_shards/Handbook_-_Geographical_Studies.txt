This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Geography is the study of social and environmental relationships. The cultural significance of geography lies in its contribution to an understanding of the total environment. Geographers are employed as professionals in urban management, regional planning, and environmental assessment.
First year courses involve systematic studies of the physical and human basis of geography. There is a progressive specialisation in the following years, with an emphasis on field observation, data handling, policy and management.
Many courses in geography include laboratory and field work, involving the use of qualitative and quantitative techniques. Assessment in Geography is normally by a combination of coursework and examinations, although the procedure varies between courses.
