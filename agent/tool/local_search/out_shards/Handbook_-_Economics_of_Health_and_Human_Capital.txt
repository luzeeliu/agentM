In this course, we will explore the importance of health and human capital to individual well-being and economic growth. We will evaluate how natural, social, economic, and political environments affect the accumulation and stock of health and human capital and the ways in which health and human capital interact with one another. We will document the considerable inequality in health and human capital across society and consider ways in which policy may help reduce this inequality.
This course is largely devoted to exploring these relationships empirically. While it is interesting and instructive to document correlations between objects, like in-utero pollution exposure and birth weight or class size and academic achievement, our ability to influence outcomes, like birth weight and academic achievement, depends crucially on our ability to identify causal relationships between objects. To this end, this course will be structured around learning key methods of causal inference in empirical research.
