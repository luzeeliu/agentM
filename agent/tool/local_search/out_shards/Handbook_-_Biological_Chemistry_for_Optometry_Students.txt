This course is designed for optometry and vision science students to build on their skills and knowledge by exploring a range of concepts that can be used to explain various phenomena in biological chemistry.
The course probes a diverse range of synthetic and biological molecules, focusing on applications such as bioenergetics and metabolism. Specific chemistry topics covered include the speed of chemical reactions, structure determination, shapes of molecules and stereochemistry, transition metal chemistry, the chemistry of carbon-containing compounds and their reactions. The biological component examines the function and significance of biological molecules including metabolism, enzyme structure and function, DNA replication, transcription and translation and gene expression. CHEM1829 also introduces students to the biochemistry of light perception, vision and colour.
The theoretical content of the course is delivered through a combination of lectures, online lessons and workshops and with problem solving skills developed in weekly group-based tutorial classes.
Theory is combined with the practical aspects of chemistry in weekly laboratory classes. The lab classes provide a high level of hands-on training in this course.
There are typically 8 contact hours per week plus a guide that you should spend an hour of independent study for each contact hour.
