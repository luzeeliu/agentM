The modification of signals and the extraction of information from them plays a key role in almost all modern systems, i.e., the signals are represented and manipulated digitally as sequences of numbers. Think about what this means in the context of commonly used devices such as smartphones – everything from reducing background noise during phone calls, to playing music, to recording videos and to AI-based recommendations are all examples of signal processing systems and all of them are ultimately implemented in terms of additions, multiplications and comparisons of numbers! Understanding the fundamentals of how mathematical manipulation of sequences of numbers relate to understanding and modifying signals is the first step in designing these sorts of systems. This course will introduce you to these concepts.
The syllabus includes the following topics: sampling continuous signals, the sampling theorem, reconstruction, aliasing, and the z-transform; filter impulse and frequency responses, stability and digital oscillators; the discrete Fourier transform (DFT); fundamentals of the design and realisation of finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters; linear and non-linear phase filters; decimation, interpolation, multi-rate digital signal processing.
