Description
This fundamental knowledge (FK) course is intended primarily for Masters of Environmental Management students who do not have an engineering background. It introduces general engineering approaches and studies their relation to ecological sustainability. In the course you analyse this relationship in different socio-economic contexts, different socio-economic contexts, including cities, rural and regional areas, and developing countries. You will address the tension between various forms of technical knowledge, the role of technology in the global economy, the relation between engineering and sustainable development and the role of engineering in environmental management. You will be taken through various case studies of real environmental problems and will be encouraged to identify where technological solutions are appropriate and where they are inappropriate or inadequate. Exclusions: This course is intended for non-engineering environmental masters programs. Engineering majors are excluded. The School of Humanities and Languages controls enrolments in the course, so please contact HAL if you would like to enrol.
