The proliferation of information systems (IS)—such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, big data analytics, metaverse, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc.—has sparked a transformative impact, offering profound benefits to individuals, organisations, and society at large. However, with these technological advancements lie not only substantial challenges in its adoption but also a “dark side” stemming from both intentional exploitation and unintended consequences, and potential misuse by well-intended or malicious actors, posing significant harm to everyone involved. With businesses increasingly reliant on a constellation of information technologies—not just AI but also on the secure, decentralised ledgers of blockchain, the predictive power of big data, and the interconnectedness afforded by IoT—for competitiveness and growth, it is imperative for Information Systems (IS) students, the future leaders of technology management, to not only excel in the capabilities of these technologies but also possess the knowledge, skills, ethical awareness, and sustainability mindset necessary to design and navigate the complex digital landscape responsibly and contribute positively to both business and society.
This course provides a realistic view of the constantly evolving technology landscape, exploring complex “wicked problems” associated with these advancements. It complements existing courses of any field by offering a critical examination of technological adoption and management.
This course is offered as an elective course for digital transformation, business analytics and cybersecurity specialisations.
