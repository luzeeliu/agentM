Study Australia's first and only combined degree in exercise science, physiotherapy and exercise physiology. This unique five-year program combines three complementary disciplines to accelerate your career in primary health.
The Bachelor of Exercise Science prepares you for the master’s program and equips you with an understanding of human movement science as well as the role and application of exercise in health, including:
Chronic disease prevention
Health promotion
Exercise prescription
Strength and conditioning
Healthy ageing
Nutrition
The Master of Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology employs a hands-on, problem-based learning model of physiotherapy education to prepare you for your future career as a healthcare professional.
This degree has a strong focus on interprofessional education, evidence-based and reflective practice, ethical behaviour, and the development of high-level clinical reasoning and professional communication skills. The program includes up to 500 hours of professional practice and clinical placements for Exercise Physiology and a wide breadth of clinical placements (totalling up to 1400 hours) for Physiotherapy. This degree will prepare you for a wide range of clinical and non-clinical careers. You will have the skills to navigate the healthcare system and seamlessly adapt to current and future health challenges.
Accreditation
This program has received Qualifying Accreditation from Exercise and Sport Science Australia (ESSA) and has been accredited by the Australian Physiotherapy Council (APC) for 2 years with conditions. UNSW is committed to fulfilling all ongoing accreditation requirements prior to graduation of the first cohort of students.
