This course takes you into the landscape to apply theory to practice and have experiential inquiry and engagement. You will encounter large-scale inclusive conservation practices that include people, culture, and the more-than-human world in the context of protected areas and learn from a range of participants who hold different orientations and perspectives. You will grapple with the challenges to conservation and protected areas through co-learning and rethinking what we do in rapidly changing socioecological contexts. By meeting with people and place, and hearing their stories, you will engage with the big issues and questions of conservation and landscape management to inform your understandings and your personal and leadership actions.
