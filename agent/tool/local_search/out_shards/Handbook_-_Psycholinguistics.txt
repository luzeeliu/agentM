This course will introduce you to the complexity and creativity of the human use of language with particular reference to first language acquisition and development. Like breathing, walking and sleeping, producing and understanding language is a natural activity that you engage in, multiple times a day, with little or no conscious awareness or effort. Psycholinguistics is a field that studies the unconscious processes that underlie this ability.
