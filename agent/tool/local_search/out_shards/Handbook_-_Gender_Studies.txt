This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The minor in Gender Studies is a vibrant, cross-disciplinary area of study that situates gender, sex and sexualities at the centre of academic enquiry and social research and policy. By approaching gender from historical, theoretical, cross-cultural and First Nations perspectives, and in relation to other categories such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, class and disability, we will equip you with the skills and knowledge to apply intersectional gender analysis to a wide range of academic, professional and community contexts. Gender studies is outward-looking, politically engaged and theoretically innovative: we aim to make this an area of study that has the capacity to help you explain the world and perhaps even to help change it.
