In this course, you will contribute to an in-depth study of a relevant health science issue. You will apply the research skills you have acquired throughout your program to: identify a specific issue that requires investigation, formulate a research question, ethically and systematically collect relevant data, analyse, interpret and discuss your findings, draw conclusions, articulate the implications of your results, and disseminate the findings to the target audience.
The research project may be a negotiated student-led proposal or be a proposal offered by an academic supervisor. Projects may be in a cross-disciplinary partnership with another School or Faculty at UNSW, or with an external stakeholder. You will be expected to carry out the research project independently, with the support of academic supervisor(s).
To fulfil the research project requirements of your degree, you must enrol in this course over two terms (2 x 6UOC) to complete a 12UOC research project.
The assessment tasks for your research project are spread over two terms (Term 2 and Term 3 of Year 5). You will receive an ‘EC’ (enrolment continuing) on your academic transcript at the end of your first term of HLTH5002. Once all assessment tasks have been completed and graded at the end of your second term, a numeric grade will be applied to your second term of HLTH5002. Further details on the UNSW grade definitions can be found here:
