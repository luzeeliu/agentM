The Bachelor of Education (Honours) is a 48 UOC (one year equivalent) advanced undergraduate degree for high achieving students which may be taken upon completion of an undergraduate pass degree in Education. The focus of the Honours year is on the further development of analytical and research skills, deepening of knowledge, and application of methods specific to educational research. The program may be a pathway into a graduate research degree (MEd Research; PhD).The BEd (Hons) can be completed full-time or part-time.
The aims of the BEd (Hons) are:
To further develop the knowledge and skills acquired by students in a specific area of education in the BEd (AQF Level 7). In particular, to inculcate higher-order research skills in critical thinking, reflection and analysis.
To understand educational research methods and approaches and their assumptions, and to apply them in research.
To deepen disciplinary-specific knowledge and to understand its theoretical frameworks and contexts of application, and to apply such knowledge while considering, where appropriate, interdisciplinary perspectives, and historical and comparative frameworks.
To appreciate the place of ethics in education and to interrogate disciplinary frameworks, assumptions and processes in light of ethical values.
