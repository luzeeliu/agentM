This course covers the instrumentation and monitoring devices available to the mining industry to monitor and manage pit slope movement. Students will be able to detail the different types of slope movement typically observed in excavated, constructed and dumped slopes, as well as the various warning signs of instability. The course will discuss monitoring strategies (e.g. targeted, background monitoring), and the link to the range of monitoring instrumentation and tools available to geotechnical engineers to manage and track slope movement.
Practical cases are used to demonstrate why monitoring is required in pit slope risk management and the advantages and limitations of each tool (e.g., accuracy, precision, data corrections). Practical application and deployment of available monitoring instrumentation and devices will also be demonstrated through case studies and in-class demonstration. This includes estimating time to failure from radar monitoring data and using monitoring data to reconcile numerical models. Risk management strategies are also discussed using Trigger Action Response Plans, Critical Control Registers, and Geotechnical Hazard Alerts.
The intensive four-day course will include guest lectures from industry.
