"
Exposure to professional engineering practice is a key element in differentiating a professional engineering degree from an applied science degree."
(Engineers Australia).  To satisfy the EA expectations of a graduating engineer, students need to have exposure to professional practice. At UNSW, this means the equivalent of 60 days of relevant Industrial Training. Students get first-hand experience in an engineering-practice environment.
Students source their own placement to gain employability skills.  Placements can be combination of traditional internships (minimum of 30 days) and UNSW industry collaborated projects.
This course is to confirm that students have completed their Industrial Training requirements.  Students must gain approval for each (up to 3 placements can be undertaken) placement by submitting the required information via InPlace.  Once 60 days have been completed in InPlace, students are required to submit a Final Report via Teams Classroom.  When all the requirements have been completed, a satisfactory grade will be awarded to ENGG4999. Opportunities, information and InPlace submission links can be found on
