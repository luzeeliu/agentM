The Master of Information Technology is a 2-year program intended for:
students with no or minimal prior computing background who wish to obtain a qualification in this discipline; or
students with a bachelor degree in a relevant discipline who want to obtain a broader understanding of computing; or
students with a bachelor degree in computer science or computer engineering who wish to specialise in some particular areas of the discipline.
The aim of this program is to provide students with a broad-based IT education, and more specialised knowledge in up to two areas, enabling them to work in a range of positions in the IT industry.
Students must complete one of the following specialisations:
COMPLS Artificial Intelligence
COMPMS Information Technology (default specialisation)
COMPNS Database Systems
COMPOS Internetworking
COMPXS Cyber Security Engineering
The following specialisation combinations are available to students wishing to take a second specialisation. Students must meet the requirements of both specialisations.
COMPLS Artificial Intelligence – COMPNS Database Systems
COMPLS Artificial Intelligence – COMPOS Internetworking
COMPXS Cyber Security Engineering – COMPNS Database Systems
COMPXS Cyber Security Engineering – COMPOS Internetworking
COMPNS Database Systems – COMPOS Internetworking
Advanced standing of up to 1 year is possible for students with an appropriate qualification.

Program Requirements
Progression Requirements
The courses in each specialisation form an articulated sequence. Students who complete the Graduate Diploma program may upgrade to the Masters program with full credit for the courses undertaken, provided they have completed the previous program at UNSW. A pass average (50) and successful completion of 18 UOC is required to articulate to the next level in the sequence. Students who have enrolled in the Masters will be permitted to exit with a Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate in the specialisation sequence providing they have completed the requirements of that program. Subject to the approval of the program authority and available places, students will be permitted to transfer to another specialisation with credit transfer being subject to the requirements of the specialisation into which the student is transferring.
