Becoming a screen production professional often means working intimately with clients to make their vision into reality. In this course you will work with an industry client to develop a project to realisation, identifying your area of specialisation and consolidating the skills to take you towards employment in the media industries. The main emphasis in this course is practical production, augmented by critical and creative thinking within a range of specialisations including Video Production, Sound and Animation. Honing your skills in a ‘real-world’ industry context, you will work in a studio team to produce original creative work ready for inclusion in your professional practice showreel or portfolio.
This course builds a complementary skill sequence when taken together with the courses MDIA1005 Creative Sound Technologies, MDIA2014 Time, Space, Experience, MDIA2000 Animating Media, MDIA2010 Serious Games, and/or ARTS2066 Writing for the Screen.
