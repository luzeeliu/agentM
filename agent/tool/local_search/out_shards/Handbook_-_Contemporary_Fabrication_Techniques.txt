This elective will focus on one of architectures primary modes of investigation; the model. As a critical part of the design process the model expresses ideas and concepts in three dimensions with concern for materials, lighting, space and, nowadays, interactivity; in other words the model literally presents all of the components of a finished architecture. Traditionally architectural models have been hand-made which both reflected the building process of the time and a cultural longing by architects to be more directly involved in the production of their work (many architects design products, especially furniture, for the same reason). But for some time now architecture has been tending towards the assembly of factory made components; and, as can be seen across the world, factories tend towards automated machine-made production. It’s worthwhile to point out at this stage that beautiful things are created in factories. Porsche, Honda, Apple, Prada and Boeing (to name a few) all use factories to create amazingly sophisticated products; most for a fraction of the cost of the average architect designed building.
If architectural models should reflect both the finished architecture and its mode of production they will need to employ automated processes such as digital modelling, laser cutting, CNC milling and rapid prototyping. However, this elective isn’t dogmatic; several hand-made processes will also be employed (hot-wire cutting blue foam, casting, sheet metal folding). In this elective students will be trained to use and have direct access to all of these machines.
In this elective students will select 3 from the number of techniques on offer to fabricate components that have precedents in architecture relating to the students design studio. Following online courses students will be expected to enroll in practical sessions. Successfully completing these courses will be mandatory.
Further assessment will be based on the physical models themselves, representations of them and critical reflection on the process and outcomes.
