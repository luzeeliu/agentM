Practical systems in the real world mostly behave in a complicated nonlinear manner. It is important that control engineers are able to understand and characterise the behaviour of such systems and develop control solutions, beyond the linear methodology, to achieve better system performance.
The course covers basic nonlinear control, design, and analysis. The analysis includes phase plane methods and Lyapunov stability and input/output stability. Nonlinear control design includes: describing functions, feedback linearisation, gain scheduling, sliding mode control, and an introduction to optimal control and reinforcement learning.
