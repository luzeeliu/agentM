Chemical Engineering involves researching, developing and improving properties of products we use every day through the selection of raw materials, the design of chemical processes, and improving the conditions for production. It's about taking projects from inception as a research proposal, through product development and on to commercialisation and manufacture. You'll learn how to apply your knowledge in chemical engineering and chemistry to optimise complex chemical processes in environmental management, general industry and services like water delivery. You'll master the entire process, extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. To get work ready, you'll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.

about Overview
Learning Outcomes
Expand all
1.
Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in the use of the methods, tools and ideas from chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computing that underpin chemical engineering.
keyboard_arrow_down
2.
Solve chemical engineering problems by competent application of technical knowledge in material and energy balances, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, particulate flow, chemical reaction engineering, transport phenomena, separation technologies, process equipment selection, process modelling, process simulation, process control, economic analysis, and safety analysis.
keyboard_arrow_down
3.
Demonstrate expertise in the design of chemical engineering systems, using established methods to create and document solutions that are technically feasible, appropriate, safe, sustainable, economically viable, socially acceptable, and standards-compliant.
keyboard_arrow_down
4.
Use systems thinking to guide engineering practice, including articulating financial and technical constraints on process design, analysing competitor processes to identify opportunities in market and technologies, developing process improvement plans, and liaising with product engineers to select appropriate process designs.
keyboard_arrow_down
5.
Make responsible engineering decisions in the face of uncertainty, complexity, and incomplete information in consultation with stakeholders, via critical reflection, and through the planning, collection, and analysis of data from research, experimentation and simulations.
keyboard_arrow_down
6.
Effectively manage process engineering projects and multidisciplinary teams with robust project planning and project management approaches that are adaptable, responsive, and appropriate in benefiting from the capabilities of diverse teams.
keyboard_arrow_down
7.
Communicate complex ideas effectively and professionally through a range of media to diverse audiences within and outside of chemical engineering, effectively incorporating feedback and being responsive to others.
keyboard_arrow_down
8.
Conduct themselves professionally, ethically, respectfully and with integrity, being accountable as an individual, as members of teams, and as a leader of teams, while recognising the social and environmental obligations of chemical engineers.
