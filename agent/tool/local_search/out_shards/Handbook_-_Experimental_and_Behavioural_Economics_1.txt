This course is meant to deepen students’ understanding of the experimental method of investigation in economics and business research. It is being offered at the Honours/MEc/PhD level.
In the course we will review questions of experimental design and implementation such as appropriate procedures of subject recruitment, programming tools, statistical and econometric analysis of experimental data, and other methodological issues in experimental economics. Importantly, students will develop their own experimental pilot project, from design over programming and the actual implementation to the analysis and write-up of a research paper. Grading will rely on two class presentations (design presentation 10% and results presentation 20%) and a research paper (70%).
