This course is ideally suited to electrical engineering students planning to pursue a career in Power Engineering. It provides an in-depth coverage on the fundamental aspects of power system protection against electrical faults, vital for the reliable, secure and safe operation of the electricity generation / transmission / distribution networks.
Topics covered include: Fundamental protection concepts and protection schemes for various power system configurations; Fault current calculations: review of sequence components, symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults; Protection devices: fuses, circuit breakers, relays, their operating principles, device rating determination, relay setting and coordination; Instrument transformers (CTs and VTs): selection and transient performance; Distance protection and protection signalling; Protection of generators, transformers, transmission lines, busbars, and feeders. The class will also discuss emerging issues and challenges in the power system protection field related to increasing penetrations of distributed generation and intelligent, self-healing networks.
