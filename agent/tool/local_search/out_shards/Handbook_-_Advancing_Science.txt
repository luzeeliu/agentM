This course introduces the interdisciplinary and collegial nature of science in society. Big problems in science are used as a framework to help students develop foundational skills essential for their careers, including thinking like a scientist, assessing the quality of information, working in interdisciplinary teams, project management, and science communication. The problems explored are varied and change each year, but may include topics such as global pandemics and human disease, nuclear innovations, and the flammable earth.
The course provides opportunities for students to network and share perspectives and experiences with peers from a range of scientific fields, and to work toward their career goals.
