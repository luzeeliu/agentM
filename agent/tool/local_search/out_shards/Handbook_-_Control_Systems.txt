Control systems engineering, a highly interdisciplinary field in Engineering, draws extensively from foundational courses in Electrical Engineering due to the complex nature of modern control systems. These systems integrate multiple components including electromechanical, hydraulic, and embedded systems into a unified structure. The design of control systems exemplifies the fusion of theory and practice, as mathematical tools from control theory are effectively utilized to address real-world engineering challenges. Studying control theory equips engineers with the ability to transform practical problems into feasible engineering solutions.
The control systems engineering course covers a range of essential topics. It begins with understanding control systems and distinguishing between simple and complex systems. Students learn analysis and design tools for simple control systems, including concepts such as differential equations, Laplace transforms, transfer functions, poles and zeros, state space models, and modeling techniques for first and second-order systems. Fundamental characteristics and performance aspects of feedback control systems are explored, such as transient response analysis, steady-state errors, and the root locus method. Additionally, the course includes topics on PID control, basic frequency response techniques, and ensuring stability in feedback control systems through analyzing transfer functions and state-space models.
