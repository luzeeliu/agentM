This course introduces you to fundamental physiological principles, from basic cellular function in terms of chemical and physical principles to the operation and interaction of body systems. Although introductory in the level of content, this course in Human Physiology is comprehensive in scope covering a range of body systems from a cellular to a more integrative approach. The areas of physiology covered in this course are cell physiology, muscle, the cardiovascular system, blood and the nervous system. The course includes engaging face-to-face practical classes in which you will work in small groups to conduct experiments that give a deeper insight into these specific topic areas, and an appreciation of how the results of experiments depend not only on what we measure but how we measure it. Face-to-face tutorials will support deeper understanding of the lecture content. Online self-directed activities and online practical classes further support the course content and learning objectives.
