With AI rapidly transforming industries worldwide, it is increasingly important for you to be familiar with AI and demonstrate the ability to confidently leverage and apply it as you prepare for the future workforce. This AI-focused capstone course provides you with a valuable opportunity to integrate the theoretical knowledge and diverse skills you have acquired across your studies, applying them to complex, interdisciplinary projects that mirror the grand real-world AI-driven challenges professionals face today. The course is structured around a major team-based capstone project, where you will collaborate over an extended period to research and design AI-driven applications. Building on the foundations established in previous courses within the AI major, such as Interaction Design, AI Fundamentals, and Machine Learning, this course empowers you to create innovative AI solutions, while encouraging you to critique and reflect on their societal impact.
Throughout the course, you will further develop essential skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, and innovation, while gaining hands-on experience with the latest AI tools and technologies in a project-based environment. You will also receive training in Agile methodologies, enabling you to effectively structure, manage, and execute your capstone projects using frameworks that closely resemble how AI projects are implemented in industry. Applying Agile principles to AI projects will provide you with valuable experience in teamwork, adaptability, and iterative problem-solving, mirroring the collaborative skills essential for real-world AI initiatives.
This capstone course will enhance your employability by equipping you with cutting-edge skills and interdisciplinary knowledge relevant to the AI-driven world. It will enable you to combine creativity, technical fluency, and agile methodology to produce AI solutions with lasting societal impact, preparing you to contribute meaningfully to an AI-powered future.
