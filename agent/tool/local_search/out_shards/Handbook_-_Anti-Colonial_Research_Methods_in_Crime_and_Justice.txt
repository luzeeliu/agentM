This course will challenge you to think about the origins of social research methods and how they shape projects seeking to investigate crime and justice in criminology. By exploring the links between methods and methodology, you will learn how research is a form of intervention across different contexts and communities. You will understand the importance of historical, theoretical, and philosophical contexts from which western research methods have emerged and consider the impact of colonial thought and power on criminological research today. You will explore the importance of reflexivity for social researchers, that is, the capacity to reflect on who we are, what we bring to the research, and the ethics of accountability. You will develop an understanding of your subjective positioning and discuss how to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies. You will engage with diverse sources of knowledge and learn how to apply anti-colonial principles in criminological and research contexts involving crime and justice.
