Human Machine Interaction introduces you to the field by engaging you in movement experiments towards the creation of responsive architectural prototypes. Viewing the built environment as a machine in interaction with its inhabitants, you will design building elements that can communicate, adapt, and interact with humans to positively impact a diverse range of people.
