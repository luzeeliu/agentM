This double degree program is specifically designed for undergraduate students wishing to pursue a career in either Engineering or Biomedical Engineering. Biomedical Engineering is the application of engineering principles to developing technologies and solving problems in a diverse range of health care related fields e.g. implantable bionics, drug delivery systems, medical imaging, radiotherapies, orthopedic devices, telemedicine, robotic surgery, cell and tissue engineering, records management, physical rehabilitation and others. This program is integrated to provide fundamental engineering skills with an undergraduate focus on an engineering discipline and specialist postgraduate level training in Biomedical Engineering.
At the end of the program successful candidates will graduate with a Bachelor in Engineering (Honours) and a Masters in Biomedical Engineering. Students are expected to perform at a credit average (65%) or better in their first three years to be permitted to continue with the Masters part of the program. Students who do not satisfy this requirement can revert to the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program.
This double degree program is currently offered for the following BE (Hons) specialisations only:
Bioinformatics Engineering
Chemical Engineering
Computer Engineering
Electrical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering
Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering
Software Engineering
Telecommunications

Free Elective Requirement
keyboard_arrow_down
Students completing the 3768 Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) / Master of Biomedical Engineering degree, must complete a total of 6 UOC free electives to meet the minimum 240 UOC required for completion. Students must substitute a  Discipline (depth) elective from the BE (Hons) or an elective from the Biomedical Engineering program to satisfy the free elective requirement for this program.
Industrial Experience Requirement
keyboard_arrow_down
Students must complete a minimum of 60 days of Industrial Training to graduate. Industrial Training must be undertaken concurrently with enrolment in the program.

Additional Information
Accreditation:
The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) component of this double degree is accredited by Engineers Australia (EA). Graduates are eligible to apply for membership with EA based on their chosen specialisation, which may include:
Bioinformatics Engineering
Chemical Engineering
Computer Engineering
Electrical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering
Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering
Software Engineering
Telecommunications
Additionally, specialisations in Bioinformatics Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering are also accredited by the Australian Computer Society (ACS).
Award with Excellence:
A student may also be eligible for the
Award with Excellence
for the Master’s degree.
Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) Progression Requirements:
Students must make satisfactory progress while studying in the BE (Hons) program. Students may be excluded from the program if any of the following occur:
Fail a core course 2 or more times
Fail more than half of the courses attempted, after completing 84 UOC or more of the BE (Hons) major
Have an overall WAM less than 50.000 with 48 UOC or more of your BE (Hons) remaining
Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) / Master of Biomedical Engineering Requirements:
In addition to the above BE (Hons) program requirements, students must perform at a credit average (65 CR) during the first three years of full-time equivalent study to remain in the double degree and continue with the Master of Biomedical Engineering. An annual check will be conducted to identify students who do not meet this requirement. Calculations are based on UOC completed, not UOC attempted. Students who do not meet this requirement may then be transferred into the single BE (Hons) program.
