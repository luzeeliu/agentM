In this studio, you will explore the design of adaptable, dynamic built spaces and landscapes on a dramatic Sydney foreshore site with indigenous and industrial heritage. It builds upon your work in previous design studios in the Architecture Program. You will need to bring your accumulated design knowledge to this studio in order to negotiate a major transition in terms of scale and complexity. This studio involves a major shift from a series of highly defined sites to a broader landscape, from a private program to a public program, from single buildings and landscapes to multiple buildings and landscapes, and from a series of discrete projects to one major design project.
