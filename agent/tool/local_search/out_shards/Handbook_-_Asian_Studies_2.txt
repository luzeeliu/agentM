The Honours program in Asian Studies requires the completion of 48 UOC (the equivalent of one year full-time study or two years part-time study).
The Honours program involves seminars and the completion of a research project or thesis. Students complete 18 UOC of coursework and 30 UOC of thesis/project. The thesis/project is a sustained research project which should be 15,000 to 20,000 words in length, written in English.
Depending on the disciplinary nature of the Honours thesis, the nature of the courses the student has previously taken, and on constraints on student numbers in particular courses, students may be able to complete the 18 UOC of coursework either from the School of Humanities and Languages or from the School of Social Sciences.
Before enrolling in any Honours coursework courses, students must consult with and gain the approval of their Honours supervisor and the Asian Studies convenor for their coursework program. Approval will take into consideration the nature of the student's Honours thesis, their previous experience in the relevant disciplines, and the capacity of the proposed courses.
