We all take electricity for granted. But have you ever considered what goes behind your outlet, when you charge your phone overnight? Electricity networks are the largest "machines" humans have ever built and the complex nature of modern power electronics converters and power systems necessitates modern approaches to their design and analysis.
Real-time digital simulations (or RTS); the solution and execution of a computation model in the same rate as actual "real-life" time; offer a modern and powerful tool that allows engineers and researchers to design, develop and troubleshoot in a safe, time- and cost-effective manner.
The main advantages of RTS in power systems and power electronics are i) very fast simulation of extended and complicated networks, ii) easy access to voltages and currents in all nodes iii) the interface with measurements, external control and power hardware and iv) the ability to run multiple test cases simultaneously and consecutively.
In this course, you will have the opportunity to explore and experiment hands-on with concepts, methodologies and practical applications of RTS across multiple modern power engineering areas. You will be able to work in a research-oriented environment and in state-of-the-art facilities that will prepare you for the future of power engineering.
