This course is a core research enquiry course for students in 8621 Master of Engineering and 8338 Master of Engineering Science programs. This is the first part of the coursework project, with CVEN9051 Masters Practice Project B, following this course in a later term. This course enhances the student’s skills for undertaking scholarly enquiry by attempting to achieve a specific topic objective within a defined period of time. A significant component of the course relates to the review of literature, which promotes independent and reflective learning as well as increases students’ capacity to develop information literacy. The project work is expected to reinforce the student’s ability and confidence in the written communication of technical information.The intention with this course is to bring into focus the skills needed to investigate real life projects. The Masters Practice Project A topic is presented to the student as it would be in industry and each student is required to prepare an individual submission by way of an Engineering Report that contains all of the elements required within the Assessment Overview. Topics are related to industry projects selected from contemporary practice. The work involves industry based investigations and design applications.
