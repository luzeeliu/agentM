The Graduate Certificate in Engineering Science program is designed for engineers and graduates wishing to develop and expand their knowledge and skills in their current discipline of expertise. This program enables students to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards and provides opportunities for continuing professional development, as well as the opportunity to interact with those at the cutting edge of their discipline.
Students will add breadth to their knowledge of engineering in general and expand their knowledge and skills in engineering management. Students will develop their technical knowledge and ability to analyse engineering problems. They will also gain further skills in solving engineering problems and justifying professional decisions.
The program articulates to the Graduate Diploma in Engineering Science and the Master of Engineering Science programs with full credit for courses completed in the Graduate Certificate program.
The program is designed to enable students to fulfil a number of needs including:
Updating technical knowledge and skills in an existing engineering specialisation
Acquiring new knowledge and skills in a different engineering specialisation
Developing and expanding knowledge and skills in engineering management
Updating qualifications and knowledge to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards
Providing opportunities for continuing professional development
Providing opportunities for interaction with those at the cutting edge of the discipline
Providing a pathway towards the Master's program.
