Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is now progressively becoming more accessible to graduate engineers for research and development as well as design-oriented tasks in industry. Mastery of CFD in handling complex flow and heat industrial problems is becoming ever more important. Competency in such a skill certainly brings about a steep learning curve for practicing engineers, who constantly face extreme challenges to come up with solutions to fluid flow and heat transfer problems without
a priori
knowledge of the basic concepts and fundamental understanding of fluid mechanics and heat transfer.
Today’s engineers are almost certainly geared more towards the use of commercial CFD codes, such as ANSYS-CFX, ANSYS-FLUENT or STAR-CCM+. This course aims to equip students with the terminology, principles and methods of CFD. The dominant feature of the present course is to maintain a balance of practicality in understanding CFD as well as providing the theoretical knowledge about CFD that can be applied in many areas of engineering, including aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, air-conditioning and minerals processing.
