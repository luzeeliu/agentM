‘Responses to Corporate Wrongdoing’ is a course that examines the different type of actions (civil and criminal) that may be initiated to deal with corporate breaches of the law. The course explores the different sanctions/remedies available to regulators and private parties to assess their suitability to deal with particular scenarios.
The first part of the course will focus on analysing the different regulatory responses taken by regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to deal with corporate (including financial) breaches of the law. This will pave the way toward studying the benefit/disadvantages of the tools available to the regulators. The second part of the course will then explores the advantages/disadvantages of private and public actions in the context of corporate breaches.
The course allows the students to evaluate the different outcomes that result from public and private actions. During the course, students will start to develop a better understanding of the different options available to regulators and private parties to deal with corporate breaches of the law and the impact that one action may have on the other.
This course combines interactive teaching, group work and exploration of relevant topics and theoretical frameworks that are of key interest to students.
The course is particularly suitable for students interested in careers in corporate and commercial litigation, criminal law and enforcement or corporate in-house roles.
