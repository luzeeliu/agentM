Geography
Description
Geography is the study of spatial and temporal variations of the phenomena which make up natural and human-dominated environments. The cultural significance of geography lies in its contribution to an understanding of the total environment. The geographer's skills also find practical application in the conservation and planned development of resources. Increasing numbers of geographers are employed as professionals in these applications. For instance, geomorphologists and biogeographers are undertaking resource inventory surveys and environmental assessment, and human geographers are engaged as urban and regional planners.
Aspects of Geography are taught within both the Faculty of the Built Environment and the Faculty of Science at UNSW.
The Geography program within the Faculty of the Built Environment focuses upon key aspects of human geography, and on natural resource management and sustainable development.
Physical geography, geographic information systems and remote sensing are taught in the Faculty of Science through the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Science (BEES).
