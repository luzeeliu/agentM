NOTE:
This course was previously identified as MNGT6712.
This course is designed to help students gain a firm understanding of the dynamics of the negotiation process and an appreciation of their own role as a negotiator. Students have the opportunity to work with the theory, skills and processes of negotiation relevant to a wide range of contexts: commercial, organisational, community and public policy.
Theory topics include power and influence, perceptual processes, intercultural negotiation, and the effects of third parties, multiple parties and teams on negotiation. Skill development includes the ability to analyse and understand negotiation situations, leading to effective planning and choice of strategy and tactics. Students are able to practise those skills by participating in role-play simulations, along with analysis and reflection on the outcomes of those simulations. Students will also learn how to incorporate ethics and responsible management in negotiations.
