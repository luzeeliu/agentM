Today, health data is measured in trillions of gigabytes and is collected by health systems (such as GPs, pharmacies, hospitals, and allied health care) as well as wearable devices. But this data is often collected for different purposes and has specific uses. What data exist in the Australian health system, and how are they used currently?
This course introduces how data are generated and used in the Australian Health System. We look at how health outcomes can be measured and reported in various forms of health data, and how these health data can reveal inequalities in health. The course describes the major sources of health data, including those relating to primary care, hospital admissions and prescription medicines. We will look at how this and other information can be used by the health data scientist to create evidence for policy and research.
