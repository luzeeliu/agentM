CHEM1061 covers a range of fundamental concepts that can be used to explain phenomena in chemistry, biological, medical, and material sciences. Students who have completed CHEM1051 previously will build on their skills to explore topics such as kinetics, structure determination, stereochemistry, transition metal chemistry, and the study of organic chemical reactions and mechanisms. The course concludes with a capstone exploration of application of organic and inorganic chemistry to synthesis, including real world situations such as drug, development, functional materials, environmental chemistry, and renewable energies; encompassing all topics explored in CHEM1051 and CHEM1061.
Students will engage with weekly digital lessons that introduce content that is then extended in live lectures and problem-solving workshops shared with CHEM1041 students. The weekly in person tutorials and laboratory classes are specific for CHEM1061 students and contain examples relevant to the medicinal chemistry program.
