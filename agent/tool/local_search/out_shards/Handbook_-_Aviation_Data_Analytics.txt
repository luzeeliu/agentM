Data analysis enables modern aviation corporates to make informed decisions. With the increasing demand for data analytics skills and data analysis techniques in the aviation industry, this specialisation allows students to obtain data science knowledge and data analytics skills in the Aviation Programme. In particular, four specialised courses are provided to equip students with technical skills to analyse qualitative, quantitative, and large datasets in the big-data era. Building on the fundamental statistical course in the first year of the Aviation Programme, this specialisation provides two stage-two courses to introduce research methods for analysing quantitative and qualitative data in aviation. Machine-Learning (ML) based models are taught to equip students with data science knowledge and Python programming skills in order to handle big data and data modeling in the operations of airlines and airports.
Two stage-three courses are provided to equip students with advanced skills in handling flight operations-related data. This knowledge and skill to analyse flight operations data enable students to solve operation-related challenges in the airline industry such as aircraft fault prediction, aircraft maintenance scheduling, aircraft routing for maintenance, and aircraft parts inventory. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models are taught to equip students with an advanced understanding of AI theories and skills to build AI-based data analytic models in solving industrial problems. This includes using large data sets to conduct time-series analysis, seasonality analysis of passenger demand, and anomaly detection in operations and aircraft maintenance. Both data science theories and scenario-based tutorials will be provided to students with hands-on experience in solving industry-oriented problems.
