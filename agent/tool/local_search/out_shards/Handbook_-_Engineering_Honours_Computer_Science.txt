Students may seek to undertake a five-year full-time double degree program leading to the award of the degrees of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (BE (Hons)) and Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) (BE (Hons) BSc). The Faculty of Engineering administers the program, and delegates administration to the School which offers the Engineering discipline selected. Students should seek advice from the relevant School Office in the first instance, from the Faculty of Engineering, or from the School of Computer Science and Engineering for the Science component.
With this double degree program, students take 168 Units of Credit (UOC) core of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) 3707 Major and 96 UOC core of the Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) 3778 Major. Because of the overlap of 24 UOC of Science courses in both core, the total UOC required for completion of this double degree program is reduced from 264 UOC to 240 UOC (please see the Double Degree Structure below for more details).

Double Degree Structure
In this double degree students take 168 UOC from the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) and 96 UOC from the Bachelor of Computer Science, for a total of 264 UOC. As there are courses required for both degrees, there is an overlap of at least 24 UOC to reduce the total minimum volume to 240 UOC.
Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) - 168 UOC
1. A 168 UOC Major consisting of the following;
- At least 48 UOC Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry-based Courses
- 30-42 UOC Introductory Knowledge Core courses
- At least 12 UOC of Disciplinary Elective courses
- Remaining UOC to consist of (Specialisation/Major) Foundation Disciplinary Knowledge courses
2. Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training
Bachelor of Computer Science – 96 UOC
1. A Bachelor of Computer Science Major
BINFAH and COMPBH and SENGAH majors are not available in this double degree.
Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering Major and Computer Science Major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional Elective course/s to bring the total to 240 UOC. Students must take these additional Electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or the School of Computer Science.
In certain circumstances, when a course overlaps the student must replace the required course in one program with a more advanced course required in the other program. For example-
1. Students must take COMP1511 as a Level 1 Core Course. COMP1511 replaces ENGG1811 or COMP1911 in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Major. COMP1511 is double counted towards both degrees.
2. Students are required to complete one of MATH1131 or MATH1141, and one of MATH1231 or MATH1241. The two MATH courses are double counted towards both degrees.
3. The Level 2 MATH course taken in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Major is counted towards the MATH1081 requirement in the Bachelor of Computer Science Major.
Note: Without following the substitutions above, students may need to take more than 240 UOC to complete the double degree.
