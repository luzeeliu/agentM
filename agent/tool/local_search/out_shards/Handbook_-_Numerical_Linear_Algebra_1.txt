The course is intended for students from Science and Engineering programs with interests in mathematics, statistics, data science or numerical simulation.
Algorithms from numerical linear algebra are ubiquitous in scientific and statistical software. The theoretical component of the course aims to impart an understanding of how these algorithms work as well as an appreciation of their potential limitations. To illustrate the applications of numerical linear algebra, a variety of examples from statistics, data science and applied mathematics are described. The course includes a substantial computing component providing practical experience with widely used software libraries.
