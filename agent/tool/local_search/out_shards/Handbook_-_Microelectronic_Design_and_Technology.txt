Overview
Microelectronics or integrated electronics is the miniaturised electronic circuits that make up Integrated Circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Flash-memories, operational amplifier, analogue-to-digital converters, SoCs, ASICs and many other devices. Most ICs today are implemented in various flavours of CMOS technology which is the focus of this course.… For more content click the Read More button below.
Microelectronics or integrated electronics is the miniaturised electronic circuits that make up Integrated Circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Flash-memories, operational amplifier, analogue-to-digital converters, SoCs, ASICs and many other devices. Most ICs today are implemented in various flavours of CMOS technology which is the focus of this course. The ability to use a large number of components at a relatively low cost and the ability to match components accurately on-chip makes the design of integrated circuits and systems different from a similar design using discrete components. Microelectronics Design and Technology is a broad-based, introductory IC design course, which takes the student through all the necessary steps in order to complete (ready-to-manufacture) a basic mixed-signal front-end in a typical integrated system.
Course content includes: basic IC processing technology: lithography, oxidation, diffusion, implantation, film deposition, etching, metalisation. CMOS IC technologies. MOS device models. On-chip components: transistors, capacitors, inductors, resistors, diodes. CMOS design rules, scaling. Tapeout and MPW, floor planning, cell layout and routing. CAD tools. Corner and Monte Carlo simulations. CMOS analogue building blocks: amplifier stages, current mirrors, active loads. Noise sources and analysis. CMOS operational amplifiers, samplers and comparators. D/A converters and A/D converters. Static CMOS gates.  Device sizing. Flip-flops. CMOS digital building blocks: level shifters, decoders, multiplexers, tri-states, buffers and adders. Memories: ROM, SRAM and DRAM cell design; sense amplifiers.
