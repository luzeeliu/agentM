Corporate governance is fundamental to the existence and growth of public corporations as it encompasses the mechanisms which help suppliers of finance assure themselves of getting a return on their investment. Its practical importance is also evident in the recent mega corporate collapses around the world. This course analyses how different governance mechanisms prevent managerial self-dealing, protect minority shareholders and add value to corporations. Specific topics include: directors responsibilities, board structure; regulations; auditing; executive compensation; financial ownership and control; shareholder activism; hostile takeovers and defence mechanisms; and the difference in governance systems in the US, UK, Australia, Japan, Germany and some Asian countries.
