Imagine using engineering skills to create solutions that improve people’s health! That’s what Biomedical Engineering is all about. It’s a field where engineering principles meet biological and medical sciences to innovate and enhance healthcare solutions, making patient care more effective.
In this specialisation, you’ll have the chance to design and develop medical devices and health technologies. These are the tools clinicians use for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring health conditions. You’ll get to explore cutting-edge healthcare solutions like imaging systems (think X-rays and MRIs), prosthetics (artificial limbs), biocompatible materials (stuff that can safely be used in the body), and diagnostic instruments.
Biomedical Engineering is a mix of different fields. So, you’ll need to understand both engineering and biological sciences. You’ll work closely with healthcare providers, using your broad knowledge to create better healthcare solutions.
Our program gives you a solid foundation in core engineering principles. But we also go deeper into how these principles apply to biomedical challenges. Plus, you’ll get to interact and work with clinical and industry professionals at the Randwick Health Innovation Precinct. It’s a great way to see how what you’re learning applies to the real world.
And speaking of the real world, we want to make sure you’re ready for it. That’s why our students complete 60 days of approved industry training. This gives you practical, hands-on experience and prepares you for a successful career in Biomedical Engineering. So, are you ready to use engineering to make a difference in healthcare?
The Biomedical Engineering specialisation will be seeking provisional accreditation with Engineers Australia at the level of Professional Engineer in 2026.
