This course introduces you to the field of forensic anthropology, and the role of a forensic anthropologist in death investigations. You will explore the techniques used by forensic anthropologists to assist with identifying human remains and establishing circumstances of death. You will learn how to analyse dental and skeletal material to estimate the age, biological sex, ethnicity and stature of an individual, and to interpret traumatic injury and pathology of bone. You have the opportunity to develop the analytical and critical thinking skills needed to perform a basic anthropological investigation, and present the results in a forensic context.
