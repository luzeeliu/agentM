Description
A brand is a fluid entity – never entirely in an organisation’s control. This is because customers ‘own’ brands. The best brand managers therefore study people. They consider brands in culture and brands as cultures. Nothing happens by chance. This course offers you theories and techniques for studying brand cultures. These theories and techniques will ultimately make you a better brand manager.
The course provides you with the opportunity to develop, hone and consolidate disciplinary skills and knowledge gained in the fields of PR and advertising, specifically in relation to the practice of brand management - which is a central aspect of contemporary PR and advertising.
This course is worth 12 units of credit, and is a Practice Pathway core subject for the Master of PR and Advertising.
