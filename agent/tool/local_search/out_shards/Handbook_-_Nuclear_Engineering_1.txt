The Department of Defence is estimating the need to grow the nuclear SQEP (suitably qualified and experience people) workforce by an additional 10,000-30,000 jobs to meet the requirements of the AUKUS deal. In parallel, growth will also be required in the non-defence nuclear supply chain, including but not limited to safeguards regulators, safety regulators, manufacturing and engineering consulting. Engineering graduates with some exposure to nuclear knowledge, as provided by a minor program, are already in high demand, in this growing sector.
The Nuclear Engineering minor aims to provide undergraduate students with a foundation in nuclear engineering, in preparation for entering the nuclear workforce. The minor encourages you to combine skills learnt from traditional engineering disciplines with specialist knowledge to solve the challenges facing nuclear technology. You will become nuclear-conversant, learn the underlying theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, explore the role of nuclear energy in a low-carbon future and gain an appreciation for the investigation and enforcement of regulations.
The 24 UOC of courses required for the minor can be course shared with courses taken for other program requirements.
Completion of the minor will require the choice of ENGG3741 as a discipline elective (or breadth elective for ELECAH3707 and CEICAH3707) within their major.
Students completing the following majors can complete the Nuclear Engineering minor within their program requirements:
Aerospace​ Engineering
Chemical​ Engineering
Chemical Product​ Engineering
Civil​ Engineering
Environmental​ Engineering
