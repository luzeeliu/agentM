In Architectural Design Studio 6, as the final studio of the undergraduate degree, you will develop a single architectural proposal to a detailed level of programmatic, spatial and material complexity. In doing so, you will focus on how architectural thinking and production is influenced by multiple environmental, technological and social factors.
You will research, analyse and interpret the physical and cultural content of a complex site to generate an architectural design strategy. From this strategy you will develop your proposal, or part of the proposal, to a detailed technical resolution. You will be assessed in relation to the resolution, coherence and imagination evident in your final design solution, as well as evidence of consistent application of thought, consideration and understanding. The employment and interface of relevant computational tools and analogue skills will be assessed alongside the final design outcomes.
