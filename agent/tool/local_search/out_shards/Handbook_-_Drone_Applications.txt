The Drone Applications Minor will provide undergraduate students with a strong foundation in applied drone operations and management - students from different majors will become familiar with the key aspects of commercial drone operations and the technologies that define the sector. The Minor also has an entrepreneurial focus that connects to the dynamic, ever-evolving nature of businesses involving drones and the constantly emerging new opportunities being enabled. This will prepare students for the unique challenges of working in small companies and organisations exploring new technologies and business models, as well as early-stage startups or companies that students may decide to found themselves. Students will combine rigorous “learn by doing” experiential coursework that includes significant drone flying (sub-2kg) and data analysis alongside other classroom work that addresses regulatory, safety, human factors, technology, workflow and communication considerations applied to real world challenges put forward by industry partners.
