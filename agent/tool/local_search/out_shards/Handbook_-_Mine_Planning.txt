Mine planning is a fundamental part of Mining Engineering. Mine planning overlays financial and technical evaluations on the underlying geology of an ore deposit. As ore deposits vary in geology, location, size, quality, and economics, the mine planning evaluation will likely lead to various outcomes, such as surface or underground mining or, in some cases, non-progression.
MINE3230 assumes a knowledge of geology and geological models. This knowledge was covered in MINE3220 and MINE3430.
Mineral commodity prices are highly variable. Students will gain knowledge of the reasons for this variability, which will lead them to achieve better mine planning outcomes.
MINE3230 examines a comprehensive array of topics, including:
Mining Systems
Optimisation Techniques
Mine Design
Mine Scheduling
Mineral Economics
Project Evaluation: Economic Evaluation & Financial Assessment
MINE3230 offers learning experiences through two projects, thereby equipping students with the knowledge and skills required for mine planning roles within the industry.  Project 1 will use the Whittle pit optimization software to evaluate the economics of a mineral deposit. The Whittle software is widely used in the international mining industry. Project 2 will evaluate the economics of a mineral project by applying various mineral cut off grades. This project will be Microsoft Excel based. Written reports will be required for both projects.
