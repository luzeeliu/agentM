There is currently significant interest in reducing energy use and greenhouse gas production in buildings by designing buildings that are climate-appropriate, implementing energy efficiency measures and producing energy from renewable sources. Prediction of building thermal, lighting performance and solar access, and techniques for energy efficient design will be introduced, with a focus on residential buildings. A competency in the use of building energy simulation software will be developed.Photovoltaics (PV) is one of the few renewable electricity generation options that can be readily used in urban areas and has no environmental impacts at the site. This course will examine the integration of PV modules into the building envelope. Technical issues associated with the use of PV in buildings and the urban environment, such as heat transfer processes, partial shading, and mismatch and system siting, sizing and configuration will be investigated.  System performance assessment and prediction will be introduced.
