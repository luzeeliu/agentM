This course provides a lecture, laboratory and field-based study of the processes responsible for shaping and modifying Australian and global coastal environments. The foundation of the course is an application of the morphodynamic approach to understanding coastal processes and hazards. Topics covered include coastal evolution, nearshore waves, currents and sediment transport, beaches, dunes and coastal hazards and management. A strong emphasis is placed on practical applications related to coastal monitoring techniques. Fieldwork is an important component of the course and a multi-day field trip will involve expense to individual students. The course is well suited to any student interested in coastal environments and hazards and/or who are studying Geoscience, Geography, Environmental Science and Marine Science.
