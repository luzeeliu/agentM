The objective of this course is to provide postgraduate students with an advanced understanding of designing RF integrated circuits in state-of-the-art CMOS technology with the ultimate purpose of integrating the entire transceiver on an IC chip. This course will build on existing knowledge from undergraduate courses on RF electronics with presumed knowledge of transmission line theory, Smith Chart and S-parameters. Course will cover the design of fundamental RF building blocks for communication systems which includes: mixers, low noise amplifiers, power amplifiers, oscillators and phase-lock loops. Noise and nonlinearity considerations in these building blocks will be treated in detail. Implications of each RF building block performance on the overall performance of an integrated communication system will be studied.
