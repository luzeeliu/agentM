The fixed income market is an important sector of the financial market on which various interest rate sensitive instruments, such as: bonds, swaps, swapations, caps, ect. are traded. The management of interest rate risk -by which we mean the pricing and hedging of interest rate products - is an important and complex issue. It creates a demand for mathematical models capable of covering all kinds of interest rate risks.The course provides an overview of various concepts of interest rates and the most important interest-rate sensitive contracts. The crucial part of the course is the presentation of various methods of modelling of the term structure of interest rates, and the variation of interest rate derivatives within the framework of each methodology.
