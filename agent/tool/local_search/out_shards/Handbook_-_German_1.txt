If you are interested in learning the most commonly spoken first language in Europe and have no prior knowledge of the German language, then
German 1
is the right course for you. Based on a communicative and task-based approach, this course is designed to help you quickly develop your proficiency in basic oral and written German. Vocabulary and basic German grammar are presented in contexts that are relevant for everyday language use. If you are a first-time language learner, we will equip you with basic language learning strategies to make your learning process more effective. The course introduces you to important facets of German societies and culture and, in this way, give you a better understanding of life in German-speaking countries.
This course is a beginners-level language course. All students who have had some experience with the language, either as a heritage language or through previous instruction, must fill in the placement questionnaire available at
https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/students/courses/language-placements
. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
