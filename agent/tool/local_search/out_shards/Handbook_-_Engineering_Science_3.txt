The Bachelor of Engineering Science (3706) is a 3-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (3707) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.
It provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams. Additional exit double degree combinations are available with Arts, Science, Computer Science and Commerce. The Bachelor of Engineering Science can also be used to provide a second, complementary area of Engineering Specialisation in the double
Materials Science and Engineering (Honours) / Engineering Science
, and
Engineering (Honours) / Engineering Science
degrees.
