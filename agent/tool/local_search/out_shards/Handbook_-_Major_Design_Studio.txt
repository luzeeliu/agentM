The Graduation Studio in the Master of Architecture program runs over two terms; the first term is the Research Studio where you will engage in a design-based research inquiry to develop a conceptual framework for your graduation project, along with your initial architectural proposals. The second term is the Major Design Studio where you develop your proposal into a highly resolved architecture project.
In the Major Design Studio you will continue in your Research Studio group to create rigorous and compelling architecture: namely Architecture and High-Performance Technology; Architecture and Housing, Architecture and Social Agency, and Architecture and Urban Conditions. Each studio explicitly supports the detailed design development of individual architectural proposals as realised through appropriate modes of architectural representation. Emphasis is placed on the development of an architectural proposition through critique, evaluation and the testing of options. The developed design will reach an ambitious level of programmatic, spatial, material, environmental and technological integration and resolution. This is expected at an imaginative and ingenious level of experimentation. You will evaluate and develop options for architectural representation styles and techniques to establish the most effective methods to communicate your work. Weekly studio-based activities, regular presentations to peers, and studio reviews with eminent critics and practitioners will guide your design development process to a coherent final graduation design project. It will be celebrated in a public graduation exhibition.
