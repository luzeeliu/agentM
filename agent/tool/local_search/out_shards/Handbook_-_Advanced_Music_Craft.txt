Advanced Music Craft invites you to work in groups of multi–skilled student–artists to develop original performance works and compositions with the support of the Esme Timbery Creative Practice Lab.
Weekly workshops on collaborative artistic process will challenge the familiar and expand your imagination through engagement with other disciplines and ways of making.
This course leads to the production of a publicly presented event where we work to professional standards.
You will work collaboratively, supported by techniques from music and performance studies, bringing diverse stories, memories, questions, and passions into relation with each other, alongside learning structures and forms that value differences as we create original performance works and/or compositions.
This course is designed for students who are interested in expanding their creativity and developing collaborative working skills that can be applied in professional contexts.
