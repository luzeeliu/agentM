This course will enable you to develop skills in extracting and synthesising information regarding linguistic diversity. It is estimated that there are over 6,000 languages spoken in the world today. Most of these languages are endangered and are in urgent need of documentation and description. It is an essential goal of linguistics, the scientific study of language, to understand to what extent these languages are different from each other. The skills and knowledge acquired in undertaking a course in linguistic typology are critical to the training of linguistic professionals who can engage in the documentation and description of languages.
