This course introduces leading edge systems thinking mapping and modelling tools to enhance your ability to diagnose and solve complex business and social problems. You will learn a flexible and powerful approach to structuring managerial problems and visualising the interconnectedness of business, social and environmental systems. You will develop skills to conceptualise and build simulation models of an enterprise, enabling you to explore the dynamic consequences of different strategy/policy decisions and identify key leverage points in the system. For example, you will build and use simple simulation models to examine the growth dynamics of businesses such as Airbnb, Uber, What’sApp, and Tesla. You will explore a broad application of business and public policy issues including firm growth and stagnation, competitive strategy, capability development and human resource policies, environmental sustainability, and the boom and bust dynamics of start-up businesses. In addition, you will examine cases of organisations that have successfully applied systems thinking and business dynamics.
