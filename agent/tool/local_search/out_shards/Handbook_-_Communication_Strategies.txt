In forming coherent strategic communications frameworks, it is essential you learn to distinguish between objectives, concepts, and tactics.

With reference to the sub-disciplines of public relations and advertising, you will be exposed to key theories and models that underpin and drive cut-through solutions to complex strategic challenges. You will learn the principles and value of research and the importance of selecting strongly aligned tactics and appropriate media channels.
