The first half of an optional and specialised individual study, enabling students to gain or extend their in depth knowledge and understanding of a particular aspect of landscape architecture. A thesis proposal, including the nomination of a supervisor, must be approved by the Program Head by the end of Session 3 Year 3. The thesis is approximately 12,000 to 15,000 words in length. Each student conducts the required research, organisation of material and writing under the guidance of their supervisor. The thesis also includes the preparation of illustrative material and completion of all necessary references and bibliography, before the submission of the final manuscript for assessment. The manuscript is assessed by two readers and returned with corrections noted, so that a final digital copy of the thesis can be submitted.
