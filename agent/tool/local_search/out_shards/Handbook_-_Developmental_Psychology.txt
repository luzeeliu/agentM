This course deals with the scientific study of developmental change in human behaviour and thought. The main emphasis will be on development over the early part of the lifespan (infancy and childhood). The course will review current methods, findings and theories relating to developmental change in a number of key areas of cognition, perception, language, social interaction and emotion. Emphasis will be placed on contemporary theories and approaches, and recent discoveries in the field. The clinical, educational and forensic implications of these discoveries will be examined. The course will be delivered via weekly lectures and face-to-face tutorials, where there is an opportunity for students to interact with teaching staff and ask questions. Tutorials will include an opportunity for students to work collaboratively to generate a proposal for new research in the area of Developmental Psychology.
