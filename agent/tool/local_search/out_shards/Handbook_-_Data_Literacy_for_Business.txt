In an era defined by data, the ability to extract insights from information is fundamental to effective leadership, policy development, and business strategy. Data literacy, i.e., the capacity to interpret, question, and communicate data, is essential for navigating complex problems and making informed, evidence-based decisions. Building this capability is therefore critical for graduates across all fields. COMM5000 develops foundational skills in data analysis and interpretation to support sound, evidence-based decision-making in business and broader societal contexts. The course introduces core concepts in descriptive and inferential statistics, including data visualisation, regression analysis, and an introduction to causal reasoning. The course develops practical skills in using Microsoft Excel to analyse real-world data and generate impactful insights. Emphasising critical thinking, clear communication, and ethical data use, COMM5000 fosters key UNSW graduate attributes and prepares students to navigate data-informed decision-making in professional contexts.
