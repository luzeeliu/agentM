Today’s data-rich environment and advances in data analytics have enabled product idea generation from the crowd, innovative “data”-based products or services development, and effective marketing of new product ideas on crowdfunding platforms. Now, “data” itself may form part of the “core material” of new products or services.
This course integrates the principles of product development with data analytics by covering (1) new product idea generation using natural language processing such as sentiment analysis or topic modelling to analyse product reviews, (2) user-centric design plan (3) data product or service development such as recommendation algorithms, (4) product attribute optimisation using A/B test or conjoint analysis, and (5) advertising new product ideas on crowdfunding platforms.
For course projects, you will exercise hands-on data analytics and marketing technology tools to conduct exploratory product data analysis and visualisation.
