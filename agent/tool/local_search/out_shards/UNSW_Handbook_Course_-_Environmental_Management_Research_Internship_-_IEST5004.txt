Description
The objective of the environmental management research internship is to provide students the opportunity to work with experienced environmental practitioners in a professional setting. Students will be expected to use the knowledge gained in previous MEM courses, and to apply it to project tasks throughout the internship. Details of the tasks will be arranged in consultation with the course coordinator or MEM coordinator and their on-site supervisor (an approved staff member within private or public sector institution or organization). Prior to placements in organizations, the course coordinator will work with students and agencies to ensure that the students are prepared, and the project is appropriate. Prior to, during, and after the internship, the student will prepare and submit an internship project brief, a series of blog posts and final report related to the project topic.
Prerequisite: Completion of 4 courses toward the Master of Environmental Management at a distinction level average (i.e. 75%).
Note: Admission to the course is competitive and subject to a written application. Please contact the
