Popular culture plays a significant role in the structure and possibilities of world politics. The relationship between popular culture and world politics is important, with significant consequences for what the world is, what it can be and how it is experienced. The course asks you to reflect explicitly on the relationship between world politics and popular culture, in both broad and specific terms. It asks you to reflect personally and politically on the intersections of questions of knowledge, power, privilege and identity in world politics. The course focuses on how the production, consumption and representation(s) of popular culture create knowledge about the world, and to what effects. This is explored by examining the intersections of, for example, questions of race, gender, sexuality, nation and class. The course asks you to build your own picture of key aspects of the relationship between popular culture and world politics, and to choose your own examples of the role that popular culture plays in the representation and dissemination of power and knowledge in world politics.
