This course enables science students studying majors in the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBMS) to apply their disciplinary knowledge and transferable skills in a professional context, through a work placement experience at an organisation external to UNSW. Students will have the opportunity to develop key professional skills that align with their career goals and contextualise their field of study in a professional workplace setting.
The main component of the course is a minimum 105-hour work placement related to the student's field of study. The placement can be paid or unpaid. This supervised workplace experience is supported by professional development and discipline-specific modules that students can select from, in line with their individual career goals.
SOMS3199 will count as a science or free elective and is graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.
The course is available to domestic and international students. If a domestic or international student wishes to undertake an overseas work placement, extra conditions will apply before the placement and enrolment into the course is approved.
