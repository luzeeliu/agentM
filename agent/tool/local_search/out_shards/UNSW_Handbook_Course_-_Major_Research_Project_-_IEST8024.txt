Description
This 24 UOC project allows Masters of Environmental Management students to conduct a substantial piece of research during their candidature on an environmental management or policy topic. It is anticipated that the research would be coordinated with a member of the Environmental Management staff, with an additional supervisor if needed. The project would run over two semesters (e.g. S2 and Summer; or Summer and S1).
There are no set classes but rather the project would be supervised and would require the student to conduct a literature review, develop research aims, methods and some sort of fieldwork/data collection (quantitative and/or qualitative). A research report would be required of approximately 10,000 words to the specifications of a relevant journal in environmental management & policy, environmental studies or science. Students may select from a range of topics as agreed with their supervisor.
Theoretical, conceptual and methodological approaches are expected to be of a high standard. Students are assumed to have undertaken IEST5004 Research Internship or have some research experience. Students are also encouraged to attend Environmental Management ethics and methods modules and workshops.
