Sociology offers a critical perspective on the societies and social worlds in which we live. It gives us the necessary tools to analyse the structures and institutions that shape our everyday lives, and to understand the role of power, inequality, and cultural difference in social relationships. A major in Sociology will equip you with the intellectual and practical tools to tackle contemporary social problems and inequalities such as those related to race, gender, sexuality, and class.  It will also help you to analyse the complexities of rapid social change, technological disruption, and political polarisation to better understand how to make change in the world. Sociology graduates are therefore ideally positioned to make an impact in roles associated with policy making and government, social and community services, and research and academia. Most importantly, sociology will change the way you see the world and your place within it.
