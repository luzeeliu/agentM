Overview
Microelectronics or integrated electronics are the miniaturised electronic circuits that make up Integrated Circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Flash-memories, operational amplifiers, analogue-to-digital converters, SoCs, ASICs and many other devices. Most ICs today are implemented in various flavours of CMOS technology which is the focus of this course.… For more content click the Read More button below.
Microelectronics or integrated electronics are the miniaturised electronic circuits that make up Integrated Circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, Flash-memories, operational amplifiers, analogue-to-digital converters, SoCs, ASICs and many other devices. Most ICs today are implemented in various flavours of CMOS technology which is the focus of this course. The ability to use a large number of components at a relatively low cost and the ability to match components accurately on-chip makes the design of integrated circuits and systems different from a similar design using discrete components. Mixed Signal Microelectronics Design is a broad-based, more advanced IC design course, which provides the students with analogue and digital circuits and design techniques required to implement mixed-signal integrated circuits with good performance and enables them to keep up to date with contemporary design methods.
Course content includes: Advanced fabrication and special IC processes (high-voltage, silicon-on-insulator, nano-scale CMOS); Technology scaling, process variation, device matching, layout for matching; Parasitics, gate leakage and wire models; Advanced transistor modelling, velocity saturation, sub-threshold operation; High-frequency analysis; Advanced cascodes and amplifier design, fully-differential circuits, common-mode feedback, rail-to-rail circuits, power outputs, biasing and references; Trimming; Active filters, switched capacitor circuits, transconductors and Gm-C filters; Non-linear circuits; Schmitt triggers and charge pumps; Sigma-delta converters and ADC calibration; Logic effort; Advanced logic families, rationed logic, special functions, oscillators, PLLs, TDCs; Dynamic logic and registers, TSP registers, timing, clock distribution, self-timed systems; Assembly techniques and packaging, latch-up, I/O design, ESD, shielding, interference and mixed analogue-digital design; Current research and reading research papers.
