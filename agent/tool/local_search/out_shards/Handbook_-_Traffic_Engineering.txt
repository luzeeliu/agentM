Traffic engineering professionals are tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the safe and efficient movement of people and goods through the provision and maintenance of transportation systems. The effectiveness of the transport system impacts the economic development and quality of life for the entire community.
The course will cover the broad topics of traffic flow theory and modelling, traffic control device design and implementation and traffic management practices. The fundamentals of traffic flow theory and the tools necessary to assess capacity and level of service for road segments and intersections are discussed in detail during the first half of the course. The second half of the course covers the application of the theory and use of the tools to conduct traffic studies and manage and control traffic related issues. Students will have the opportunity to analyse real traffic data, develop traffic management plans and design traffic control devices using industry prevalent modelling software, such as "SIDRA Intersection", which will provide students with the necessary practical skills to be a traffic engineer.
