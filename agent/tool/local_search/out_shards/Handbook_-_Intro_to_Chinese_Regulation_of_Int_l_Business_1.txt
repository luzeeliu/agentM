As China becomes one of the world’s largest economies, an understanding of Chinese regulation of international business is crucial for students and lawyers working in the field of business and economic law. China’s approach of regulating international business is in some ways different from other countries such as Australia and is rapidly developing. Recently China has introduced an enormous number of new laws governing international business which affect international trade and investment in many aspects. This course will provide students a comprehensive introduction to China’s regulation of international business, both law and practice, including the new developments. Unlike more specialised courses, this course will consider all these issues holistically and in context, showing how they relate to each other and together make up a coherent legal order of China.
This course is designed both for students who wish to have a thorough understanding of Chinese law and practice of international business and for commercial practitioners who are developing practice in a wider range of business areas with China.
Main Topics
Chinese legal system and business environment
Foreign Investment Law (FIL)
Trade law
Intellectual property protection
Merger control and competition law
Dispute resolution
China’s trade and investment agreements
