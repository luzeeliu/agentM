Recommended Program Electives
keyboard_arrow_down
Students in the Economics and Finance specialisation are strongly recommended to complete COMM5007 as their MCom program elective to complement their specialisation; particularly prior to completing ECON5106.
Students who are interested in broadening their knowledge in this specialisation are also encouraged to complete FINS5513 as a MCom program elective where possible under the program structure.
Course Sharing for Double Specialisations
keyboard_arrow_down
Students who complete two specialisations that share a common Foundation Core Course (COMMKS and ECONFS, FINSCS and FINSQS, or MARKGS and MARKTS) must take an additional 6 UOC of Electives or Capstone Courses. These students are strongly recommended to choose another specialisation course as their additional Elective.
For example, in Finance, and Economics and Finance where FINS5512 are requirements for both specialisations, students are recommended to complete an additional specialisation core elective course – e.g. FINS5510/FINS5530.
