This course immerses you in the history, politics and culture of Sydney and through them, introduces you to the interdisciplinary field of Australian Studies. You will explore the city through walking tours and from many vantage points, including its beaches, rivers, parks, subcultures and multicultural communities. You will learn more about the past and present of Aboriginal Sydney, Western Sydney and Queer Sydney, and be encouraged to make your own fresh discoveries through a dedicated research project. Drawing on a vast range of historical and contemporary accounts, the course traces Sydney’s extraordinary urban transformation from a tiny penal outpost to a global city of international renown in only 200 years. In learning about Sydney, you will learn about urban development worldwide, the DNA of modern cities, and what makes them tick.
