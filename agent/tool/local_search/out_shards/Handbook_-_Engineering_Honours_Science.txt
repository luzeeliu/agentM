Students may seek to undertake a five-year full-time dual degree program leading to the award of the degrees of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Science (BE (Hons) BSc). The Faculty of Engineering administers the program, and delegates administration to the School which offers the Engineering discipline selected. Students should seek advice from the relevant School Office in the first instance, from the Faculty of Engineering, or from the Faculty of Science for the Science component.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC (after the 24 UOC reduction from double counted courses).
Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (168 UOC)
A 168 UOC Engineering stream consisting of the following:
At least 48 UOC Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry-based Courses
30-42 UOC Introductory Knowledge core courses
At least 12 UOC of elective courses
The balance of stream to consist of Foundation Disciplinary Knowledge Courses
Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience.
Bachelor of Science (96 UOC)
Core Courses
An approved Bachelor of Science Major
Science Elective Courses
Employability Experience Courses
In this dual degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Science, for a total of 264 UOC. Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.
In some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,
Students completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:
Civil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Mechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Electrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Software Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411

Students may not count 'COMP' courses towards their Science requirements unless they are specified as core courses in their major (i.e. for these students 'COMP' courses will not count as 'Science' courses).
Enrolment Disclaimer
Please read the Double Degree Program rules as some specific rules apply to particular Double Degree combinations.
You are responsible for ensuring you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and advice from your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program.

Additional Information
All combinations of Engineering program and Science majors are possible within five years of full-time study. However, to complete these combinations, special exceptions are made when undertaking the following Science majors in the Bachelor of Science:
Mathematics Major
Students will need to replace the second year Mathematics courses in their Engineering program with second year Mathematics courses required for the Mathematics major. For further information on this, students should see staff in the School of Mathematics and Statistics or the Student Hub team.
Biology, Ecology, Geography, Earth Science, and Marine and Coastal Science Majors
Students, will be exempted from completing MATH1041 Statistics for Life and Social Sciences and BEES2041 Data Analysis for Life and Earth Sciences when MATH1131 Mathematics 1A, MATH1231 Mathematics 1B, and a relevant second year statistics course has been completed as part of the Bachelor of Engineering. For further information on this, please contact the Student Hub team.
Physics Major
Students may need to replace the second year Mathematics courses in the Bachelor of Engineering with second year Mathematics courses required for the Physics major. For further information on this, students should contact the School of Physics.
Biotechnology and Neuroscience Major
Students may need to use their first year Engineering elective to take a course for this major, otherwise, it will require 246 UoC to complete the requirements for the Engineering degree and Science major. This could involve additional study, extra cost and may have visa implications for international students. Students wishing to major in Biotechnology or Neuroscience should seek advice from the Student Hub team as soon as they start planning their enrolment.
Bioinformatics Major
Students are not permitted to declare a Bioinformatics major in the Bachelor of Science if they are completing the Bioinformatics stream as part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours).
COMP Courses
In all Engineering/Science dual degrees, COMP courses do not count towards the Science component and will not contribute to the minimum 96 UoC of required ‘Science’ courses.
3767 UOC Requirements
Where students complete the requirements for the Bachelor of Engineering and the Bachelor of Science in less than 240 UoC, the remaining elective courses taken to bring the total to 240 UoC must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science
Accreditation:
This Engineering component of this dual degree has the same accreditation status as the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons). For details please see Program
3707
Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) Progression Requirements:
Students must make satisfactory progress while studying in the BE (Hons) program. Students must show cause not to be excluded from the program if any of the following occur:
Fail a core course 2 or more times
Fail more than half of the courses attempted, after completing 84 UOC or more of the BE(Hons) major
Have an overall WAM less than 50.000 with 48 UOC or more of your BE(Hons) remaining.
Students must also satisfy UNSW’s progression requirements. For more information on university policy on progression requirements please visit
