Climate change and sustainability are key challenges for our society and economy today and these areas provide great opportunities for future employment. Governments and non-governmental organisations around the world have engaged in various climate change and adaptation policy initiatives to ensure survival and prosperity of current and future generations.
This course explores issues related to reporting on climate change and sustainability and its implications for businesses. As the course is offered in the Business faculty, it is only appropriate to focus on business activities with ethical and social significance that are often omitted from conventional profit-oriented business transactions. Insights on established and proposed policy frameworks will provide students with an overview of sustainability reporting and the ability to start preparing a sustainability report in their current or future employment. Impact of the recent establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) by the IFRS Foundation will be covered particularly the release of sustainability standards and how Australia is responding to this generational shift in business reporting. This course will be useful for students who aspire to work in leading accounting and consulting firms and climate and sustainability advisors.
