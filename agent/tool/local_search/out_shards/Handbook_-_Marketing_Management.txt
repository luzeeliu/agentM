NOTE:
This course was previously identified as MNGT6251.
At the core of every successful business model are the organisation’s value propositions. Leaders of contemporary organisations must understand how the organisation creates and manages value propositions based on understanding the wants and needs of key stakeholders. This list of stakeholders includes existing and potential customers (a.k.a. clients or funding bodies), employees, suppliers, partners or collaborators, investors, government/regulators, and communities. Doing this successfully means that through appreciating the impacts of complex conditions in the external environment, contemporary leaders are better able to create, communicate, deliver, and sustain value for their stakeholders, and capture value for the organisation. This requires an understanding of the core processes and practices of marketing management.
