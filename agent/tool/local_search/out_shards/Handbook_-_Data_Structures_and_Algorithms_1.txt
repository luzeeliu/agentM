Data structures are about how data is stored inside a computer for effective and efficient use. An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem within a finite amount of space and time. Data structures and algorithms are not only important in software design, but also in hardware design. Being proficient in data structures and algorithms are essential for good software developers, hardware developers, and system architects.
The actual content is taken from a list of subjects that constitute the basis of the tool box of every serious practitioner of computing: data types and data structures, abstract data types, dynamic data structures, analysis of algorithms and a variety of fundamental algorithms for graphs, search trees and text processing.
