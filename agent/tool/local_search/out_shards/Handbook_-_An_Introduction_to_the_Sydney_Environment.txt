Please note that several exercises in BEES6601 build on previous classes and all assessment tasks are described, discussed and workshopped in classes. This means that all (face-to-face) classes are compulsory. The last meeting for BEES6601 is the final exam (in the last week): it is completed online but students MUST attend the exam session in person.
