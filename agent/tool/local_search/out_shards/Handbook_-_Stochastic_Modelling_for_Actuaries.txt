This course discusses actuarial models for stochastic modelling of liabilities and assets, demonstrating their use in actuarial practice. The course will cover topics such as Markov chains in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, focusing on their application to experience rating; Markov process models and their applications in areas such as insurance, financial risk, survival, sickness, and marriage models; Monte Carlo methods for simulating stochastic processes; and the estimation of Markov chains. Students are expected to implement these models using R software in a numerical computing environment.
