This course introduces students to mathematical models for the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans. The equations of motion are exploited to provide simplified models for phenomena including the effects of the Earth's rotation, large-scale balanced flows, waves and potential vorticity, and the energy balance in the climate system. Some fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics are developed first and then allied to the oceans, to the atmosphere, and to the role of both in the climate system.
