3566 Economics / Advanced Science (Honours) Special arrangements for Mathematics and Economics courses
keyboard_arrow_down
Students should do the MATH courses which are required in the Advanced Science (Honours) specialisations they choose – eg. Mathematics and Statistics specialisations specify MATH1131/MATH1231 or MATH1141/MATH1241 rather than MATH1031/MATH1041. With a few of the Advanced Science (Honours) specialisations only one MATH course is required, in which case students will be required to complete one of either ECON1202 or ECON1203.
For ECON1202, the substitute courses are: MATH1031 or MATH1131 or MATH1141.
For ECON1203, the substitute courses are: MATH 1041 or MATH1231 or MATH1241.
The ECON courses are not substitutes for these MATH courses. No credit will be given if students also complete the ECON courses.
ECON1203 may be substituted by PSYC2001 for those students who also do a major in Psychology.
The courses ECON1202 and ECON1203 can only count towards the BEc component of the degree.
