Space is a realm for humankind and human space activities transcend national boundaries. Hence there is a need for space regulation to be implemented at both international and national levels. This exciting course gives engineering students seeking a future in the space industry a solid grounding in space law and radio regulations.
The course starts with an introduction to legal frameworks and the formulation of laws. It then covers the international treaties that comprise the international regulatory framework for space activities, leading to the study of national legislative systems with a focus on the 1988 Australian Space Activities Act. The various engineering, environment, and regulatory implications of these legal systems will also be discussed. The course will then discuss the interaction between Space Law and developments in space technology as well as the impact of Space Legislation on Engineering decisions.
