This advanced course within the 3D Visualisation disciplinary studio will provide you with the opportunity to immerse yourself in the field of computer modelling and computer-generated visualisation and refine your knowledge, methods and skills. Expanding in complexity and drawing on the skills already acquired in the preceding courses, you will design and create an experiential, explorable and 3D virtual world. Scholarly research will provide an informed foundation for the creation of a sophisticated, conceptually focussed virtual environment. Engaging studio workshops will explore the full computer-generated imagery workflow with a particular emphasis on how 3D assets engage and relate to each other in a realtime platform, low-poly modelling and a high level of art direction in the creation of your own virtual world.
