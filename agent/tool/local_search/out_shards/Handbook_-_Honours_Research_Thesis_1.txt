The course is designed for LLB (Honours) students and permits the learner to undertake a research project on a legal topic of his or her choice. The course is designed to develop the students’ research skills and writing by exposing them to different research methods. The course will also enhance the students’ knowledge in a particular area of the law.
When enrolling in this course, the student must have completed the prerequisite preparation course so they commence this course with a clearly defined topic which has been approved by the academic supervisor of the student. Students should approach potential supervisors to discuss a) their availability to supervise the project and b) the suitability and formulation of the topic. It is expected that this topic will be refined prior to the commencement of this course.
At the completion of the course, students will produce an original piece of research by engaging with legal research and using a distinct legal methodology. They will also have developed advanced skills in presenting and editing their own writing, as well as in providing constructive feedback on the work of others.
At the completion of the course, students will be submitting a 10,000 thesis.
