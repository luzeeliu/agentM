This course is designed for students with basic knowledge of French equivalent to two terms/semesters of studying the language at university level. With a communicative and task-based approach to foreign language learning, you will learn to communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. You will develop your listening and speaking skills as well as your reading and writing skills through varied activities and tasks done in class and/or prepared at home. Vocabulary and grammatical structures are presented in the context of culturally relevant issues from France or the Francophone world. The medium of instruction is French.
Please note, students who have not successfully completed ARTS1481 but who have had previous experience with the French language (either as a heritage language or previous instruction) must do the placement questionnaire available at https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/hal/study-us/resources-support/language-placements. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
