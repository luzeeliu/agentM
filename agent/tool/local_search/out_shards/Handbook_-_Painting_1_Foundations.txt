Painting embraces a diverse and exciting range of forms from natural earth pigments bound with plant resins to synthetic colours bound with acrylic. Paintings can be made on surfaces as different as found industrial objects and human skin. Painting has different languages and different traditions across multiple cultures and histories and is ever evolving. Using the studio as a central focus, you will be introduced to the practice of painting within a contemporary art context. Working individually and collaboratively in the studio you will complete a range of practical tasks that will give you a foundation in painting practice. You will learn how to use painting tools, materials, supports, and how to work with colour and tone to create paintings. In a stimulating and supportive studio environment, you will present your paintings for discussion with peers and develop skills for giving and receiving feedback. You will be introduced to the practices of contemporary painters and encouraged to visit leading galleries and spaces located in the local area to inspire and inform your development.
