Crime and justice issues dominate politics, the media and popular culture. This course looks critically at the development and nature of 'law and order politics' and the media's fascination with crime, both of which govern popular understandings of crime risks and threats, and what may be considered appropriate policy responses to them. You will reflect on how and why crime and criminality have become a source of public fascination as well as a policy area on which elections may be won or lost. You will also examine how crime news is constructed and the implications of these constructions for those who are criminalised, victim-survivors, and the public. In exploring these issues, you will engage with numerous examples and case studies from contemporary politics, news and entertainment media, and popular culture.
