This course is available to undergraduate students enrolled in an Environmental Science program. The course examines the legal and policy issues likely to be encountered by an environmental scientist and addresses the question: Is the adversary system the most appropriate method of dealing with conflict in determining the appropriate use of resources? The difficulties encountered with the multiplicity of authorities and interactions between local government regulations, state and federal laws and international law are considered. Case studies examined at each of these levels are used to provide a brief overview of current environmental law in Australia and the World, with examples.
The aim of this course is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles of environmental law; and to explain how these principles are applied. The course assumes that participants have little or no background in the law, and so the course also provides some basic instruction about important legal concepts and structures as well as policy approaches to implementation of regulation and enforcement of the law.
The learning outcomes expected on the completion of this course include:
Demonstrate knowledge of the various sources of environmental law and policy
Identify the influence of common law and international environmental law on the development of Australian law
Explain the structure of environmental laws and engage in critical analysis of the different methods, both regulatory and incentive based, that may be used to implement environmental policy
Demonstrate comprehension of the different ways in which environmental disputes may be resolved
Navigate and apply knowledge of environmental planning and assessment processes in the context of natural resources
Demonstrate awareness of the social and economic context in which environmental law and policy has to be made and recognise the various pressures and influences on the search for optimal environmental protection laws
Demonstrate effective oral communication skills by delivering accurate and insightful contributions in class;
Demonstrate effective written communication skills by articulating legal and policy concepts clearly, persuasively and appropriately
Demonstrate an ability to incorporate a range of legal and interdisciplinary research sources in written communication with appropriate referencing.
