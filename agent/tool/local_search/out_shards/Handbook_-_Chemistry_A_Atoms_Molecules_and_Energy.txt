This course builds on an elementary knowledge of chemistry (high school chemistry or equivalent) to explore the quantum mechanical structure of atoms leading to an understanding of the periodic trends in the properties of the elements. This knowledge is applied to understanding chemical bonding and intermolecular forces which together are responsible for determining the properties of materials. General principles of chemical equilibrium are developed and applied to chemical reactions involving acids and bases. The applications of the laws of Thermodynamics to chemical processes are described and ultimately linked to chemical equilibrium. The course concludes with an overview of chemical reactions involving electron transfer, including their applications in biology, corrosion and energy storage for portable electronic devices.
Note: Assumed knowledge equivalent to year 12 chemistry.
