"With the right technology, we will have a world where 'I can't' becomes 'I can’… but that technology you can only get if someone makes it."  (Jeff Paradee, Disability Advocate)
That someone can be you! Join us in this course to change the lives of people living with disability.
Working in a group of students and a person with disability, you will utilise the principles of co-creation to design and prototype a piece of technology that promotes participation or enhances healthcare provision.  Check out this video on the course

Past projects include customised rowing prostheses, modification of workshop tools for people with quadriplegia, sensorising walking frames to increase independence of older persons with low vision, squeeze gyms for children with autism, the list goes on! All projects are proposed by their end users, so you know that what you make will have an immediate and profound impact.
This unique course will show you first hand the important role that engineering has in improving and changing lives.
ENGG3060 is delivered over two terms: Term 2 (Design) and Term 3 (Prototype). You are supported throughout the course by academic mentors and makerspace staff through a variety of educational activities, including guided workshops, student-led meetings, and design and prototyping dig-ins. The course concludes with a showcase event where you will demonstrate your prototype to end-users, students, and staff, and evaluate the prototypes of other groups in the course.
Come and join us! We’d love to show you the wonderful world of rehabilitation engineering and the difference it makes to people’s lives.
