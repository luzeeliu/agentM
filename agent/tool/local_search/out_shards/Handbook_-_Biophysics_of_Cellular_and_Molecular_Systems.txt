This course will equip you with a deep understanding of the fundamental and cutting-edge concepts in cellular biophysics and their critical relevance to modern biomedical science. The field of biophysics is reliant on precision in experimentation and sophisticated analytical techniques that have revolutionised our understanding of biological systems. Through a rigorous exploration of topics such as computational modelling, structural biology, and single-molecule imaging, you will gain the ability to critically evaluate current biophysical methods and their applications in deciphering complex biological phenomena.
A key focus of the course is to develop your ability to select and apply appropriate quantitative techniques to address a wide range of biological problems. You will learn to seamlessly integrate qualitative insights with quantitative approaches, enabling a holistic understanding of biological mechanisms at both the molecular and macromolecular levels. The course emphasises the design and execution of experiments, guiding you in choosing the most suitable techniques and analysis frameworks for their research objectives. By the end of the course, you will be adept at designing robust biophysical studies, critically analysing data, and contributing novel insights to the field of biophysics.
