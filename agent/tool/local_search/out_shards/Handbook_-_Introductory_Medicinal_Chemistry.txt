This course will provide students with an understanding of what medicinal chemistry is and how it is carried out. Topics covered in this course include a general overview of structure and bonding in organic molecules, the drug discovery process, and macromolecular therapeutics. The interdisciplinary process of how pharmaceutical drugs are designed and developed will also be introduced.
The course is based on a series of lectures, tutorials, workshops and colloquia given by academic staff plus visiting specialists, on topics of relevance to medicinal chemistry. Students will have the opportunity to visit some of the biomedical facilities located on the UNSW campus.
The course is only available to students enrolled in medicinal chemistry-related programs (3999 and 4755) and are usually in their first year of study. This course cannot be used as a general education course.
Note: Assumed knowledge equivalent to year 12 chemistry.
