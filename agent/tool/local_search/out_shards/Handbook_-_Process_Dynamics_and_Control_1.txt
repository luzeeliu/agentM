Modern chemical plants are managed via complex control systems. It is crucial, that you, as an aspiring chemical engineer have a working knowledge of process dynamics and how control systems manage plant operations. Mastering this field will enable you to improve process safety, ensure product quality and increase cost-effectiveness of process operations.
In the first part of the course, you will learn to develop models and analyse the dynamic behaviour of a range of processes. Using the language of Laplace transforms, you will express the dynamics of linear control systems in terms of transfer functions, a form of models that facilitate the analysis of process dynamics and control design.
The second part is concerned with control system design incorporating both qualitative (building on earlier studies on P&IDs) and quantitative (i.e., control algorithm design) approaches. You will learn stability analysis and control system design approaches. You will also learn the basics of digital control systems, including data acquisition, signal filtering, discrete-time modelling and digital controller design. Some widely used advanced control strategies will also be introduced. By making extensive use of the specialist software, students will be able to quickly apply the concepts of process control and design control strategies.
