This postgraduate course introduces the mathematical modelling and theory of problems arising in the flow of fluids in the Earth's climate system. During lectures and tutorials, the dynamics underlying the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans are detailed using key concepts such as geostrophy, the deformation radius and the conservation of potential vorticity. The role of Rossby waves, turbulent boundary layers and stratification are also discussed. The atmosphere-ocean system as a global heat engine for climate variability is examined using models for buoyant forcing, quasi-geostrophy and baroclinic instability.
