Renewable energy from natural sources (e.g., sunlight, wind) is increasingly replacing fossil fuels for electricity generation, usually in the form of small-scale distributed generation sources. Power electronics plays a crucial role in the practical integration of such energy sources into the electricity supply networks. This course is intended for all of you who may want to work in industry or academic environments where power electronics converters are used. These consist of the design, application and maintenance of converters used for applications including power supplies, motor drives, distribution grid networks, renewable energy generation sources, high power transmission and many more.
Specifically, this course will cover:
Multiple types of DC-DC converter
Grid-connected inverters
Three-phase inverters
Wind turbines
Photovoltaic electrical systems
HVDC transmission systems
Multi-level converters
The topics to be covered in this course will include: Grid integration of electrical power from renewable sources; Current and voltage control; Advanced topics in DC-DC converters, inverters, AC-DC converters and AC-AC converters for use in utility interfacing; resonant converters for DC-DC conversion; dynamic representation of DC-DC converters, control loops design; converter circuit and system modelling using LTSpice or other platforms, device selection and their modeling, thermal design, gate drive circuit design, magnetic core and other component selection and design, and case studies of converter system designs.
