Since the late 20th century, the economic ascendancy of China has accompanied its rise as a major global power. In 2021, China declared that it had eradicated extreme poverty. Yet poverty has defined and haunted modernity in China, and economic inequality and precarity persist as significant social issues. Poverty shaped China’s project to catch up with the West in the late-Qing and Republican periods, drove the rise of socialism, and continues to afflict the postsocialist period in evolving guises. This course explores the dramatic social and economic transformations of modern and contemporary China, through the lens of literature, film, and other art forms. You will examine how the gap between rich and poor has been a major theme inspiring innovations in aesthetic forms. Topics will include the evolving dynamics of family, gender, and class; the tension between tradition and modernity; the differences of city, country, and everything in between; the hopes and disillusions of socialism and postsocialism; and the challenges faced by migrant workers and marginalised communities.
