Description
This is an advanced course in microscopy, which provides practical, research-oriented experience. The course covers the principles and practice of conventional light microscopy, including an understanding of the preparation of routine paraffin and frozen sections, as well as advanced resin-embedding methods and specialised light microscopic techniques such as phase contrast, darkfield and Nomarski differential interference contrast; enzyme histochemistry; immunostaining techniques; fluorescence and confocal microscopy including principles of quantitative microscopy (morphometry). Furthermore, the course will introduce high-end microscopy techniques such as high-resolution microscopy (e.g. PALM.STED), 2-Photon Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy. The course will thus help students to gain a better understanding of the correlation between structure and function.
