Overview
The double degree, Bachelor of Engineering Science / Bachelor of Computer Science (3738), is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) / Bachelor of Computer Science (3785) program.

The double degree, Bachelor of Engineering Science / Bachelor of Computer Science (3738), is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) / Bachelor of Computer Science (3785) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.
The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.
The Bachelor of Computer Science involves the study of the design, construction and uses of computer systems. It is concerned with the representation of data and data structures in computer systems and the design of algorithms for automatic manipulation of this information by programming languages and machine systems. It is very much concerned with the design and development of hardware and software tools by which computer applications may be developed, but not so much with the applications themselves. It is, however, noted that non-computing elements (such as human interface or psychological aspects) can often dictate the level of success of computing systems. At UNSW, particular emphasis is given to comprehension of the basic principles behind computing tools, operating systems, compilers and translators, and computer hardware.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Engineering Science (96 UOC)
96 UOC Engineering Science major
6 UOC Free Elective*
Bachelor of Computer Science (96 UOC)
96 UOC Bachelor of Computer Science major
6 UOC Free Elective*
BINFC1, COMPF1 and SENGD1 are not available in this double degree.
In this double degree students take 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering Science, and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Computer Science, for a total of 192 UOC.
*Students are also required to complete 12 UOC of Free Electives. These can be used to take Engineering or non-Engineering courses. Students take these free electives with 12 UOC freed up from overlapping courses. The set of overlapping courses varies depending on the combination of Engineering Science major and Computer Science major.
Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering Science major and Computer Science major there may be additional overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses (on top of the required 12 UOC of Free Electives) to bring the total to 192 UOC. Students must take these additional electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or School of Computer Science.
Students MUST take COMP1511 as their first year Engineering Science computing course.

Engineering Science Specialisations
keyboard_arrow_down
The Engineering Science specialisation component requires completion of 96 UOC of Engineering courses, chosen from those listed in the relevant BE (Hons) discipline specialisation.
At least 24 UOC of these courses must be from Level 3 or above.
Course substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
