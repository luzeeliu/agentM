Overview
This course presents a unified and advanced approach to the study of transport phenomena, which unifies the topics of mass, momentum and heat transport. Fundamental concepts and methods will include: methods for prediction of transport properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivities); equations of change in 3-D for isothermal fluid flow,… For more content click the Read More button below.
This course presents a unified and advanced approach to the study of transport phenomena, which unifies the topics of mass, momentum and heat transport. Fundamental concepts and methods will include: methods for prediction of transport properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivities); equations of change in 3-D for isothermal fluid flow, heat conduction, diffusivity, and finally the general case of simultaneous transport; dimensional analysis of the equations of transport and its use in scale up.
Applications of the basic equations to the study of forced and free convection, laminar flow, turbulent flow, heat conduction, diffusion and multi-component systems will be presented. Case studies will include: viscometers, transpiration cooling, free convection heat transfer, simultaneous heat and mass transfer, evaporative cooling, drying, mass transfer with chemical reaction, etc. Multidimensional and transient problems will be covered, as will those involving compressible flows, non-newtonian flows and turbulence modelling.
Most analysis nowadays involves the use of numerical software. Therefore, an introduction to the numerical solution of partial differential equations will be given, followed by the use of commercial numerical software such as COMSOL to solve practical problems.
