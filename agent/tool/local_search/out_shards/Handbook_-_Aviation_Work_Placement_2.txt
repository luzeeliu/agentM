This course is the second of the Aviation work placement courses and builds on the skills and experiences gained in AVIA3199 Aviation Work Placement 1.
AVIA3199 must be completed as a co-requisite or pre-requisite to AVIA3299.
This work placement course is for School of Aviation students who wish to extend their work placement experience by completing a longer work placement (over two terms) or a more intensive placement (more hours in one term). Placements may be paid or unpaid. The three work placement options available to students are provided below -  the same eligibility and approval processes apply for all work placement options.
Option A:
105-hour placement completed in 1 term; enrolment pattern = AVIA3199; total of 6 UOC
Option B:
210-hour placement completed in 1 term; enrolment pattern = AVIA3199 and AVIA3299 in the same term; total of 12 UOC
Option C:
210-hour placement completed over 2 terms; enrolment pattern = AVIA3199 in one term and AVIA3299 in the following term; total of 12 UOC
In completing an extended or intensive option, students will have the opportunity to further develop professional workplace skills and engage in deeper self-reflection and analysis of the experience as a stepping stone into a graduate career.
Like AVIA3199, AVIA3299 will count as a science or free elective and is graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.
The course is available to domestic and international students. If a domestic or international student wishes to undertake an overseas work placement, extra conditions will apply before the placement and enrolment into the course is approved.
