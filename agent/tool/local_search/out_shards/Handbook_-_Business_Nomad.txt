Situated in a real-world international setting, students will collaborate in interdisciplinary and intercultural teams to collectively develop innovative ideas to address the pressing challenges presented by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.
The goals recognise that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic development.
Students will apply different problem-solving frameworks to complex sustainability problems and develop viable, inclusive and equitable solution options that promote sustainable development and economic security at the local level and further afield.
