In the world of advertising, knowing how and when to apply your theoretical knowledge in practice will make you a more valuable employee and a more satisfied professional. Advertising has always been a dynamic area of promotion, but it is evolving in exciting new ways thanks to a range of socio-cultural and technological changes. This course takes you through key areas of the advertising process to explore real situations from the client to the agency, across account management, strategic planning, creative, digital, and media planning, and how teams collaborate to deliver. This will help you understand how advertising works, how it’s changing, and how it’s created. The course focuses on the advanced practical skills and knowledge needed to undertake modern advertising activities successfully, as well as the development of industry-ready portfolio materials. Whether you’re planning a career within an agency or on the client-side, you will better understand the reality of advertising in action.
