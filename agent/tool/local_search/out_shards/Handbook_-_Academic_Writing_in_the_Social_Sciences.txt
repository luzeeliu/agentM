In this course, you will be taught the academic skills you need to succeed at the masters level. This course will be particularly useful for students who have not studied at an Australian university or who are returning to university after a period in the work force. You will learn the key stages in the research and writing process, how to construct compelling paragraphs, including introductions and conclusions, how to engage convincingly with others’ work, how to read and write critically, and how to make effective use of theory. To give you an opportunity to practice these skills, your assessments will enable you to apply these skills in a range of formats, focusing on particular themes that are addressed by international policy frameworks.
