Description
Introduces modern biochemistry, covers fundamental aspects of the structure-function relationships of proteins and an overall coverage of intermediary metabolism. Major topics covered include: the nature and function of proteins and  enzymes; the metabolic working of cells, tissues and organs; the interrelationships between the pathways of carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism; the vital role of hormones in metabolic regulation; the energy-trapping mechanisms of animals and plants; interesting variations on the central metabolic pathways in various life forms. Practical work to complement the lectures and to introduce the principles of biochemical analysis.
