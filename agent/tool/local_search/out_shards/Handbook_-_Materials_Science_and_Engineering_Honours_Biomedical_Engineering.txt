This handbook entry is for students commencing their studies from 2024. Please refer to previous editions of the handbook for pre-2024 requirements.
This double degree program is specifically designed for undergraduate students who wish to pursue a career in biomedical engineering, leveraging the technical foundation of materials science and engineering. The program is integrated to provide fundamental materials engineering skills at the undergraduate level and specialist postgraduate training in Biomedical Engineering.
The materials science and engineering component of the program focuses on the study of the structure, properties, synthesis, and applications of the major classes of materials, including metallic, ceramic, polymeric, composite, and bio-inspired materials. The biomedical engineering component applies these principles to develop technologies and solve problems in a diverse range of health care related fields, such as implantable bionics, drug delivery systems, medical imaging, radiotherapies, orthopaedic devices, telemedicine, robotic surgery, cell and tissue engineering, physical rehabilitation, and others.
At the conclusion of the program, students will graduate with two degrees: a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering and a Master of Biomedical Engineering. Students are expected to perform at a credit average (65%) or better in their first three years to be permitted to continue with the Masters component of the program. Students who do not satisfy this requirement can revert to the 3131 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering program.
