DPBS1190 teaches students the fundamental analytical and statistical tools an organisation uses to gain insights about customers, markets, competitors and itself. In this course students apply statistics and data analysis skills to real large data sets with a focus on applications, rather than methods. They will learn how to describe, collect/source and analyse business data from a variety of business domains such as finance, marketing, management, risk analysis, etc. Effectively communicating data insights and recommendations to a non-technical audience, including data visualisation and simple dashboards, rounds off this highly applied and hands-on course.
Link to other courses: DPBS1190 immediately builds on Evidence-based Problem Solving (DPBS1110), which introduced the basic statistical tools suitable for small data. Students will also find the analytical skills from DPBS1190 useful to deepen their learning from Creating Value (DPBS1180) and Organisational Resources (DPBS1170).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
