This postgraduate course focuses on the continuous-time modelling of financial markets. The main goal of the course is a detailed study of the classical Black-Scholes options pricing model and extensions. The notion of a continuously rebalanced trading strategy is introduced, and the arbitrage-free and completeness properties of a financial market model are examined. The course also introduces and studies the concepts of historical, implied and stochastic volatilities. We study contingent claims of American, Asian, barrier style in the Black-Scholes model. In the final part of the course, alternative models to pricing contingent claims in continuous time are explored.
