This course is specifically designed for students enrolled in the
Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology
program. It focuses on the pathology, pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and assessment of neurological function, as well as impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions arising from disease and trauma to the nervous system. An evidence-based and person-centred approach to neurological physiotherapy is emphasised. The course covers acute neurological disorders (such as stroke, acquired brain injury, and spinal cord injury), cerebral palsy, and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis). You will develop competency in the assessment of motor impairments and secondary adaptations, and gain skills in planning and delivering safe and effective neurorehabilitation. The course employs a hybrid learning approach and includes simulated case scenarios, live/ pre-recorded lectures, online learning modules, and practical hands-on workshops focused on applying theoretical knowledge to clinical reasoning and practice.
