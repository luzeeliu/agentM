Can you imagine Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman, Sam Neill or Kate Winslet as scientists? Well, Hollywood has, in a series of movies which use real scientific concepts as an integral part of the plot. Often the script writers stretch these concepts beyond the realms of reality to make the movies even more exciting.
In this general education elective that is delivered completely asynchronously via pre-recorded material, you will view a series of movies which deal with a range of scientific issues with accompanying lectures to help you understand the concepts.
Movies you will watch include Gattaca (starring Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman), Jurassic Park (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern), The Day After Tomorrow (Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum) and more. So enroll, see some movies and you might learn enough science to create your own genetically modified organism, alternative source of energy, deep space exploration vehicle or help save the world from a cataclysmic disaster.
This course is delivered purely online! There is no prior knowledge required, anyone can take this course no matter their scientific background.
