Description
The course encourages a critical analysis of the policy-making and implementation processes within current and neoliberal modes of governing - framed around the notion of interpretive policy analysis and 'policy mobilities'. It utilises several specific environmental issues and natural resources (water, biodiversity, renewables and non-renewables) as well as 'urban environments' from which the class studies their framing in public debate and by policy-makers. The course provides an advanced discussion and critique of policy-making and implementation processes at different scales (local, state, national, global) and in different modes of governing (e.g. including the role of corporations, NGOs, individual citizens and other non-governmental entities). You will gain practical insights into key environmental issues and the capacity to apply this knowledge to environmental policy making and policy implementation.
