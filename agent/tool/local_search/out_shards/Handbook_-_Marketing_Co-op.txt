The UNSW Co-op Program is a scholarship program set up by industry and The University of New South Wales to provide financial support and industry training for selected undergraduate students. The UNSW Co-op Program is based on existing undergraduate programs at UNSW with the following special features:
For high achieving students the UNSW Co-op Program offers an ideal combination of challenge and opportunity.
Co-op students receive structured industrial training and gain valuable work experience with up to three different employers.
On graduation, sponsors generally look to recruit Co-op Scholars.
UNSW academics and senior managers from industry and government have jointly planned Co-op requirements.
At present we have 150 of Australia's leading industries sponsoring 300+ scholars across 24 different programs.
This specialisation is within a four-year degree BCom(Co-op) program which includes coordinated industrial experience. Industrial experience extends outside University terms.
Marketing is a dynamic management discipline concerned with exchange processes in competitive markets. It is of critical importance in all sectors of the economy, including local and international businesses, and profit-making and non-profit making organisations.
The business function of marketing seeks to identify the needs and wants of customers, determine potential target markets, design appropriate products and services, communicate this offering to customers and distribute it to the marketplace. A wider goal of marketing is to create an organisation-wide ethos that is responsive to customer needs, aware of competitive forces, and builds on core strengths of the organisation.
