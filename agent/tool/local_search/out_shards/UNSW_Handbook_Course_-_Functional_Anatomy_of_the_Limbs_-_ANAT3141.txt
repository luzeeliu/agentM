Description
This course follows on from ANAT2111 and ANAT2511 and complements the other level III anatomy courses (ANAT3121, ANAT3131 and ANAT3411).  The course aims to provide a detailed understanding of the anatomy of the limbs and the functional principles underpinning limb movement including an understanding of the functional aspects of muscle, joints and the mechanics of movement. Lectures focus on the musculoskeletal anatomy of joints and joint movement of the limbs.  This is correlated to movement as it is related to exercise conditioning, clinical case applications and surface anatomy.  Laboratory classes involve the study of prosected and plastinated specimens, models, X-rays and surface anatomy. Tutorials focus on the anatomy of the limbs using the applications of clinical cases and muscle conditioning exercises - these use online learning tools.
