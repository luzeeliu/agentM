Imagine yourself in the heart of a typical Parisian café in Saint-Germain des Prés, discussing great ideas and “reinventing the world” in the spirit of Hemingway, Sartre or Picasso! This advanced French language course will let you explore contemporary, innovative, often controversial or provocative views on a broad range of topics relevant to the evolution of our world: medicine, science, politics, philosophy, economy, identity, gender, culture, etc. You will read, watch and listen to authentic material taken from recent publications such as radio excerpts, podcasts, TV documentaries or press writings. Finally, you will share your ideas with the class, both verbally and in writing, and debate in a safe environment, respectful of individuality and diversity.
This course is open to students who have reached a B1 competency (CEFR), equivalent to completion of UNSW French 6. New students have to fill in a placement questionnaire to be accepted in the course.
