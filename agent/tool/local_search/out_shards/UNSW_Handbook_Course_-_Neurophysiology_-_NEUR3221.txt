Description
Brain mechanisms in sensation and perception are analysed in detail for vision, hearing and touch, and for the position sense arising from muscles, joints and the vestibular apparatus.  The sensorimotor mechanisms responsible for the control of fine movement and postural regulation are also studied at different levels of the nervous system, from the sensory and motor nerves within muscles through to the highest levels of cerebral cortical function. Segments are also included on nerve transmitters and neuromodulators; neural mechanisms in certain higher functions, eg language and memory; and nervous system plasticity. Experimental work introduces the student to electrophysiological and other neuroscience research techniques, and in seminar-discussion groups to a critical evaluation of neuroscience research literature.
Please note: students may not enrol in NEUR2201 Neuroscience Fundamentals in the same semester as NEUR3221.
Note: Enrolment in this course may be subject to quota restrictions. Such restrictions will only apply to students taking this course as an elective.
