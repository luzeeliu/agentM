In this course you will learn essential techniques and vocabulary for analyzing, explaining and interpreting fictional and documentary films. These skills may also be applied to other audio-visual media. You will learn to recognize and apply specialized film studies terminology by closely studying films drawn from a range of contexts and historical periods.
The content and design of this course has been developed to allow you to gain a broad appreciation of a variety of methodological approaches to studying film as a specific discipline. Films and reading material have been selected to provide you with a sense of the historical and cultural variability of film as an expressive medium and to expose you to different ways of watching, thinking and writing about film.
The films you watch will convey the richness and diversity of cinema as a form of both popular entertainment and art. They have been carefully selected to challenge, entertain and, in some cases, deliberately frustrate your expectations regarding ‘good cinema’. After completing the course, you will possess a greater appreciation of film as a medium and a better understanding of how film style shapes meaning and the viewer experience.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
