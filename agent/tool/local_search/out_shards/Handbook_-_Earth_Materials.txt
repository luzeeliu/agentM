This course is an introduction to the identification, classification, analysis and formation of rocks (igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic) and minerals, with special reference to the rock-forming minerals. Also included are extraterrestrial materials and gem minerals, including Australia’s national gemstone, opal. Lectures and lab classes will also cover mineral and rock analysis techniques, an introduction to geochemistry, radiometric dating, volcanic processes and products, X-ray diffraction, and optical properties of minerals and rocks under the polarizing microscope.
There is a one-day fieldtrip associated with this course to the near South Coast of NSW during which you will learn a variety of general geological field techniques. For this trip, you will have to contribute to the cost of bus/coach hire for the day.
This is a core course for the Earth Sciences major and covers the broad fields of mineralogy and petrology which are fundamental for further courses in Earth Sciences. Students will synthesise the knowledge and tools gained to solve problems using real-world examples.
Assumed knowledge: GEOS1111.
