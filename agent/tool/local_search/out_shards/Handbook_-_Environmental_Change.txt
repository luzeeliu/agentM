Overview
Due to increased greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, the climate is changing: heatwaves, droughts, floods are becoming more frequent and more intense, ice-mass loss from Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating and sea-level is rising. Future climate projections are derived from climate model simulations, but how are these models benchmarked?… For more content click the Read More button below.
Due to increased greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, the climate is changing: heatwaves, droughts, floods are becoming more frequent and more intense, ice-mass loss from Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating and sea-level is rising. Future climate projections are derived from climate model simulations, but how are these models benchmarked? Past climate changes provide a unique opportunity to understand the climate system to better project its trajectory. This course provides an overview of past climate and environmental change and of the processes that were involved. The course is designed to be accessible to all upper level science students.
GEOS3761 is delivered as a blended course: online lectures are complemented by face-to-face practicals. The course has a Moodle Discussion Forum which provides an opportunity to engage with everyone. The students will get hands-on experience with techniques to reconstruct and understand past climate change.
