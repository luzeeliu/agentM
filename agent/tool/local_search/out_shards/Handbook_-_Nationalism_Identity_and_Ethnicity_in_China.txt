By examining China, one of the largest multi-ethnic society in human history as a case study, this course intends to acquaint students to the concepts of ethnicity, (ethno)nationalism and identity. Using historical, anthropological and political approaches and theories, it unravels issues related to these notions, as well as the friction they sometimes stimulate at local, national and international levels. It  particularly addresses questions related to peoples who live in the frontiers of China, such as the Tibetans, Uyghurs and Mongolians,  and appraises the interactions between the centre and the periphery, as well as between majority and minority groups through time and space. Through lectures, selected readings, empirical case studies, films, music and discussions, this course provides a unique opportunity to explore the diversity within China, ethnic/national identities, gender and ethnic hierarchies, religions, socio-political conflicts, notions of assimilation and integration, as well as nation-building.
