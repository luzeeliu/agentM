This is an introduction to those areas of Mathematics which (amongst other things) underpin important areas of computing. The main topics are integer and modular arithmetic (including tests for primality of integers), polynomial algebra (including factorisation of polynomials and construction of new fields), and an introduction to cryptography and error-correcting codes.
The course is delivered through a series of lectures and tutorials, along with weekly self-paced online lessons. All topics are taught from first principles, but due to the relatively fast pace of delivery, MATH1081 – Discrete Mathematics is recommended prior knowledge. The course provides a strong foundation for students intending to study higher-level mathematics or computer science, and is a core course for the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Software) degree.
Since the introduction of digital computers, the renewed importance of discrete and thus finite theory in mathematics has become apparent. For this reason, MATH2400 – Finite Mathematics should prove useful to future Computer Scientists and Software Engineers while at the same time providing Mathematics students with an introduction to ideas in Number Theory, Finite Fields, Cryptography, and Algebraic Coding Theory. The related course MATH3411 – Information, Codes and Ciphers develops some of these ideas in greater depth.
