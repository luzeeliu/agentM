This course introduces issues in graphic design and its significance in society, including communicating identities, designing for national and global audiences, graphics as strategic communication between the client and the public, and design as social policy. As a social activity, the graphic communication of image and text engages critical reflection in the production and consumption of knowledge, for example meaning making in national iconography, product advertising and editorial design.
This course comprises a series of integrated lectures, learning activities and assessment tasks that inform your ability to analyse and synthesise printed and screen-based graphic designs. You will apply this knowledge in the creation of your graphic design responses to the design brief.
