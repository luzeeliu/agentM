The UNSW Master of Development Studies is designed to equip graduates with theoretical knowledge and practical skills to analyse and address some of the greatest contemporary challenges faced by communities and societies across the globe. The degree builds your skills and knowledge of participatory, rights and community-based responses and approaches which recognise and draw on the expertise and knowledges of local communities. Informed by critical development studies theories and methods underpinned by human rights, gender and intersectionality, social and environmental justice, you will develop frameworks to understand the causes and drivers of global and local inequalities and the complexities of the diverse contexts in which development takes place. You will learn from a team of academics with practical real-world experience and expertise locally, in Australia, and internationally.
