Managing Just Transitions
introduces students to the emerging framework of
Just Transitions
, which builds on the foundational business concept of
Creating Shared Value (CSV)
—coined by Porter and Kramer (2011)—to enhance competitiveness while advancing social and economic outcomes for communities.
This course repositions CSV within a broader, systems-level perspective that investigates decisions of
justice, fairness, and inclusion
in navigating structural changes such as decarbonisation, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, and automation. Students will critically examine how businesses, investors, governments, and civil society can work together to reimagine economic futures that are both
environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive
.
Through interdisciplinary theories and real-world case studies, students will explore Just Transitions across five key conceptual domains and associated value spheres:
Stakeholder Value and CSV (
corporate values) – Understanding the evolution of stakeholder value and the integration of social needs with market expansion and business innovation.
Civic Wealth Creation
(community values) – Examining how community-driven entrepreneurship, participation, and coalition-building generate economic, social, and communal value.
Place-Based Development and Investment
(financial values) – Investigating financial models that acquire, absorb, and deploy capital equitably across different communities and geographies.
Indigenous Knowledge and Systems
(cultural values)
– Exploring the Indigenous business sector and the role of cultural values in fostering sustainable, community-led development.
Ethical Infrastructure and Intergenerational Equity
(individual values) – Engaging with long-term governance frameworks that consider who benefits from change, who bears the costs, and how future generations are impacted.
Designed for future leaders, strategists, and change agents, this course equips students with the critical tools to design, assess, and lead transitions that align business innovation with societal and environmental resilience.
