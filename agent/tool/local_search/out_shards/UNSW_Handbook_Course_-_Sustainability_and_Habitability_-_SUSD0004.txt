Description
This course provides an overview of the complex interrelationships between human beings and the built environment which underpin habitability (liveability, quality of life) as a dimension of sustainability. Frameworks to describe, explain and interpret these human / built environment relations and interactions at different scales are introduced and applied, drawing on current research. The course discusses the potential for policy, planning, design and management of the built environment to influence habitability across the fundamental human dimensions of health and wellbeing; safety and security; comfort and amenity; and access, equity and community engagement. The course is structured around lectures, readings and class seminars; assessment is based on both individual and group work.
