This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
German Studies at UNSW places special emphasis on integrating the study of social, historical and cultural developments in Germany with the teaching of practical language skills. This approach aims to enable you to achieve a high level of communicative competence in German while offering you a critical understanding of this fascinating modern European society. You will not only develop your knowledge of the German language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of Germany. Learning German will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Germany. Developing competence in German will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.
In the advanced sequence you will, and in the intermediate sequence you may, complete some components of your sequence via cross-institutional study. You are responsible for enrolling yourself before the appropriate UNSW and partner university deadlines for cross-institutional enrolment, which fall well before the beginning of regular UNSW teaching periods. See
Cross Institutional Study
.
Each course of cross-institutional study requires approval from the appropriate UNSW convenor, with whom you must consult at an early stage to discuss your selection of courses. Once you have successfully completed German Studies courses cross-institutionally, you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, i.e. specific grades will not appear on your transcript.
If in a given term you are unable to take appropriate courses cross-institutionally, you may be eligible to apply for an individual variation of your program.
