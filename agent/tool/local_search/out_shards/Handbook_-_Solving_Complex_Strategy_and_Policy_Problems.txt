In an increasingly complex, uncertain and interconnected world, systems thinking and analysis skills have become a key requirement for managers and policy makers. This course introduces leading edge systems thinking tools that we will apply to solve real business strategy and social policy problems. This includes working throughout the term on a live case with a senior manager from a local organisation (i.e., a not-for profit organisation, government agency or commercial business), culminating in presenting recommendations to the senior management team at the end of the term. Using systems thinking to communicate solutions to complex problems, working as an effective team member, and influencing others to provide innovative strategies and solutions will strengthen students' employability. Also, for BCom students MGMT3004 will satisfy your program requirements to complete a Final Year Synthesis course and also helps you earn myBCom points.
