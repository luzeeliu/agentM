In this course you will extend Immunology concepts that were introduced in BABS3041, and gain an advanced understanding of the clinical application of immunology, including its role in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease.
You will examine the components of innate and adaptive immunity and their interactions, and investigate the clinical and pathological basis of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity disorders, autoimmunity, cancer immunology and immunity to infection. These topics are considered in both clinical and research context, including immuno-diagnostics, immune-modulation and immunotherapy, systems immunology and big data immunology and vaccine immunology.
The course will be particularly beneficial if you are wishing to pursue a career in the health sciences, especially medicine, immunology, biomedical research or hospital-based laboratory work. An advanced understanding of clinical immunology will provide you with a practical framework for approaching the diagnosis and management of common clinical scenarios, equipping you with skills that are directly relevant to real-world healthcare and research environments.
