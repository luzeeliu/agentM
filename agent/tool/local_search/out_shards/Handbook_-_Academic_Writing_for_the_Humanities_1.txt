This course will assist you to develop your capacity to write academic essays according to the conventions of the Humanities. It provides the knowledge and vocabulary by which you can critically analyse the work of others as well as your own. The course focuses sustained attention on various modes of academic writing that are used in essay writing and shows how these may be deployed to present a strong argument. The course includes analysis of a range of exemplars as well as essays from academic journals researched by students and related to their disciplinary interests. This study will be accompanied by writing exercises, writing workshops and detailed feedback from both peers and staff.
The course is offered as a Prescribed Elective in the Master of Journalism and Communication and the Master of Public Relations and Advertising. Students enrolled in other Postgraduate Coursework Programs in UNSW Arts and Social Sciences, may take the course as an additional elective, but it will not contribute credit toward those programs.
