The Neuroscience Honours stream is run jointly by the School of Psychology and the School of Medical Sciences (SoMS). Neuroscience Honours facilitates interaction of the students with the broader neuroscience community at UNSW. The Neuroscience Honours stream is open to all students who majored in Neuroscience or who are eligible to enrol in Honours in the School of Psychology or School of Medical Science and have a background in disciplines allied to neuroscience (as evidenced, for example, by completion of NEUR courses).
The research project will be conducted under the supervision of an academic in SoMS or Psychology, or with a conjoint member of those schools from an Institute such as NeuRA or the Garvan. A list of available supervisors, their research areas, and the research skills that you would learn, are available on the Neuroscience Honours Supervisors page. You should speak with one or more supervisors before submitting your application form.
The Neuroscience Honours course is a research based full year research project with assessment by thesis (75%) and by a coursework component (25%). Students must enrol in two 6 UOC courses from NEUR441X and NEUR442X (current courses are NEUR4411 Behavioural Perspectives in Neuroscience and [[NEUR4421 Biomedical Perspectives in Neuroscience). The research project occupies the other 36 UOC, which students take by enrolling in a combination of NEUR444X Neuroscience Research courses that add up to 36 UOC.
