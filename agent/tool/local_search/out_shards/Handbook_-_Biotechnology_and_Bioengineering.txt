Overview
In order to bring new biotechnology products to the market, scalable bioprocesses must be developed and validated. This course covers the bioprocessing and economic principles involved in the operation, development and design of large-scale biotechnology-based processes. It includes analysis of fermentation kinetics, batch and continuous modes of operation, bioprocess optimisation,… For more content click the Read More button below.
In order to bring new biotechnology products to the market, scalable bioprocesses must be developed and validated. This course covers the bioprocessing and economic principles involved in the operation, development and design of large-scale biotechnology-based processes. It includes analysis of fermentation kinetics, batch and continuous modes of operation, bioprocess optimisation, principles of fermentor scale up, downstream processing and bioprocess design, as well as principles of economic feasibility analysis. Selected bioprocesses will be used to develop an understanding of fundamental bioprocessing principles, including process scale-up. Examples will be drawn from major biotechnology sectors, including biofuels, biopharmaceutical manufacture and manufacture of other bioproducts from bacterial, yeast and mammalian hosts. Laboratory sessions and problem-solving tutorials (including computer-based classes) will supplement the lecture material. At least one detailed case study will be undertaken by students which will investigate the economic and technical feasibility of a bioprocess.
The course BABS3631 Biotechnology and Bioengineering (Advanced) is taught in tandem with BABS3031 and includes extra assignment tasks and a distinct laboratory project component that extends students’ knowledge in one or more current areas of bioprocessing. The advanced version of the course is intended for students undertaking the Advanced Science program.
