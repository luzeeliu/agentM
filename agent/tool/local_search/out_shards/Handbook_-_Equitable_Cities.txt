Equitable Cities examines contemporary issues facing planners working in a diverse and complex society. It engages with the broader social, economic and cultural shifts which are continually reshaping the neoliberal city. You will consider questions of spatial disadvantage, social exclusion, spatial justice and equity, and rights to the city.
Change in the built environment invariably impacts on disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups disproportionately. As planners we must steward the future direction of our cities and communities in ways which value and foster diversity, and make decisions which affect the built environment's ability to support healthy behaviour.
The course explores the role and capacity of current planning frameworks to achieve more equitable and health supportive outcomes, including the preparation of community strategic plans, the use of social and health impact assessments, as well as more creative interdisciplinary and bottom-up consultative approaches and working practices.
