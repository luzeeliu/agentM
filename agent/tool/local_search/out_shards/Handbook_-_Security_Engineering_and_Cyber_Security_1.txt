In this introductory cybersecurity course we look at Security Engineering – the engineering principles behind designing, monitoring, and maintaining security in the face of an adversary.  We explore selected case studies and examine the practical principles behind effective security. We introduce the fundamental ideas of security and then we look at how these are applied in current cyber security practice. We will pay particular attention to systems which fail and the importance of thinking like an attacker. This course involves analysis, critical thinking and design. A cunning and devious mind will be an asset. Although our main concern is cybersecurity, the engineering principles we cover apply to security more generally.
This course introduces modern cybersecurity design and practice, and is suitable for anyone with a playful analytical mind and a general interest in security. We do not assume a programming background.  We concentrate on analytical skills and the engineering approach to security design. We'll also bring you up to date with the current main trends in cybersecurity.
In this course you will undertake an applied self directed security project.
There is an associated "Extended" version of this course (COMP6841) for students who can code, ideally in C, and who know low level concepts such as memory implementation and function calling.  CSE students will probably choose to take the extended version but are not required to.  You can transfer between the courses before the census date if you can't make up your mind in advance which is better for you.
The precise topics covered in this introductory course change somewhat from year to year to keep the coverage up-to-date and relevant. As you will see cybersecurity has recently been and remains a rapidly changing field. The field is now way too big for us to cover everything in detail in just one course but by the end of course you will have an overview of the major topics in contemporary security, a good understanding of the current state of play, and have begun to think like a security engineer.
After completing either of these courses (COMP6441 or COMP6841) you can proceed to the other UNSW Computing Security Courses covering topics in:
Digital forensics
Penetration testing
Memory corruption and exploitation
Software assurance
Incident response
Malware analysis and reversing
Cryptanalysis
Cloud Security
Professional issues and leadership in security
Web application security
Fun special projects
Masterclass
Our intention is to make this a highly enjoyable course. The field is quite stimulating as the security mindset you will develop involves understanding know how to break things in creative ways (as well as how to create things as is traditional in computing) with puzzles, cunning, cloak-and-dagger antics and a never-ending supply of amusing stories. However it will not be an easy course – you are expected to master the underlying theory *and* to be able to apply it to real world situations. There is a lot to learn and we expect you to work hard and study in your own time.
