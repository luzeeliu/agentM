The Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (Honours) is designed for talented students with exceptional analytic skills and a thirst for the knowledge and expertise that will help them build the technologies of the future. The Core courses provide a solid grounding in the fundamentals of programming, software engineering, computer hardware, data structures and algorithms. Computing electives provide technical skills and a broad knowledge of the field, while advanced computing electives and Honours thesis allow for an in-depth understanding in a specially chosen area. Free electives can be used to pursue other topics of interest. This degree provides excellent preparation for postgraduate study, for joining or building a technologically innovative organisation, or making a substantive contribution to information technology in any field of endeavour.
The Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (Honours) is currently only available to existing UNSW students via internal program transfer (subject to WAM requirements). The program will be available for application by prospective students in 2023.

Program Requirements
Internship, Placement and Exchange Opportunities
Students in this program can complete an optional exchange through UNSW Exchange, as other students can.
Progression Requirements
Before commencing the Honours thesis, students must have a WAM of at least 65, and must have completed:
- 66 units of Core courses specified in the default Stream (COMPCH)
- 30 units of Computing Electives (Level 3 or higher)
- successfully completed at least 120 UOC overall
Students enrolled in the Advanced Computer Science (Honours) program are required to maintain a weighted average mark (WAM) of 65. If a student does not maintain this minimum level of academic performance, they will be transferred to program 3778 Bachelor of Science (Computer Science). Entry to Honours may still be possible for these students by application to enter program 4515 Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours).
Students enrolled in the Advanced Computer Science (Honours) program who wish to take out the Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) award at pass level without proceeding to Honours, are required to transfer to that program (3778). Transfer requests should be submitted via the Internal Program Transfer (IPT) application in myUNSW.
