Actuarial Studies is concerned about more than just mathematics and numbers. It combines study in mathematics, economics, insurance, finance, statistics and programming. This
double degree
will allow interested students to complement their Actuarial Studies with business analytics.
The analytics skill set is one of the core sub-disciplines of the actuarial profession. The data analytics space is a rapidly evolving area with broad reaching applications. The advent of big data has led to an explosion in captured data, analytics approaches and businesses harnessing this data to create new industries or reinvent the way existing industries operate. Pursuing a joint program in Information Systems allows students to build up their business analytics skills. This will assist students to use modelling and data analysis techniques on large data sets to discover predictive patterns and relationships for business use. Solid skills in programming will also assist students during their actuarial career and actuarial employers report an unmet demand for candidates who have proficient business analytics skills.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 192 UOC.
In this double degree 96 UOC is required for the Bachelor of Actuarial Studies, and 120 UOC is required for the Bachelor of Information Systems for a total of 216 UOC. However, some first year Business courses required for both degrees overlap,  and therefore the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Actuarial Studies (96 UOC)
Level 1 Core Courses* (48 UOC)
Level 2 Core Courses (24 UOC)
Level 3 Core Course (6 UOC)
Level 3 Actuarial Electives (18 UOC)
Bachelor of Information Systems (120 UOC)
Business Core Courses (30 UOC) - Students are not required to complete COMM1100, COMM1110 and COMM1190 as the content is covered by the Economics and Mathematics courses taken in the first year of the Actuarial Studies program. Also COMM1240 (which is equivalent to COMM1140) and COMM1180 are completed as part of the Actuarial Studies program and also count towards meeting this rule*. Students therefore are not required to enrol in any additional Business Core Courses listed in the rule below to meet this requirement.
Information Systems Core Courses (72 UOC).
Information Systems Electives (12 UOC) - see note below.
Work Integrated Learning (6 UOC)
NOTE: special substitution arrangements exist depending on your choice of electives as follows:-
If you select INFS3603 Introduction to Business Analytics you do not have to take COMM2501 Data Visualisation and Communication in the Actuarial Studies program. INFS3603 will be counted towards the requirement for COMM2501.
If you wish to take INFS3873 Business Analytics Methods, completion of ACTL3142 Statistical Machine Learning for Risk and Actuarial Applications as an elective in the Actuarial studies program can be counted as a substitute for INFS3873 and will satisfy this as an elective in the Information Systems program.
Electives
Due to course sharing across the Actuarial Studies and Information Systems components, students will meet the disciplinary component requirements of the two awards in less than 192 UOC. Once the requirements for the Actuarial Studies and Information Systems programs have been met, students need to take free electives (including Business School electives) to ensure a total of 192 UOC is completed for the Double-Degree
