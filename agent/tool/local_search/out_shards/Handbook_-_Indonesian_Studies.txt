Cross-Institutional Arrangement with University of Sydney
keyboard_arrow_down
If you undertake Indonesian Studies as a minor, you may complete some components of your study through cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney. Once you successfully complete Indonesian courses cross-institutionally, you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, that is, specific grades will not appear on your UNSW transcript.
If you are a Commonwealth-supported student (domestic undergraduate student) in a UNSW program you will pay the student contribution amounts at the University of Sydney for each course. If you are an international student you will pay the corresponding tuition fees.
You will be required to pay the Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) at the University of Sydney. You may seek a refund for the corresponding UNSW fees if you are concurrently enrolled at UNSW.
You are responsible for all travel and any ancillary or incidental costs or expenses.
If you undertake cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney, you are responsible for ensuring that all the requirements for your application are completed and submitted by the deadlines advertised.
The cross-institutional arrangement with the University of Sydney is subject to annual review by both Universities. It may be discontinued or varied at any time at the Universities’ sole discretion. If the arrangement is discontinued, UNSW will put in place alternative arrangements so that students can finish their study.
Please note, if you are considering cross-institutional study, you should contact the Nucleus Student Hub (https://nucleus.unsw.edu.au/en).
