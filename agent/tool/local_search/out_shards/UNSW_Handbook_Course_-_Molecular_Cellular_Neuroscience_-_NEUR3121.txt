Description
This course provides an integrative approach to understanding cellular neuroscience. It begins with an understanding of cell membranes and the mathematical equations that describe the movement of ions. It then builds a repertoire of the key molecules that underlie the processes of signalling in neural cells. These are then combined to understand the behaviour of neural cell signalling and how these may be manipulated experimentally to understand the function. Topic areas include: how electrical signals are generated across cell membranes; the function, properties and structure of ion channels, receptors and transporters; how nerve cells communicate with each other in the brain, including synaptic transmission and receptor-mediated signalling; how alterations in function can lead to disease states; modern experimental techniques in cellular neuroscience; application of molecular biology techniques to manipulate and explore the function of molecules in the nervous system. The course provides an ideal introduction for further studies in neuroscience and pharmacology, and provides a foundation for the understanding of higher physiological systems.
