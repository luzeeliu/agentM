Events have been central and prevalent to our society and life. Increases in leisure time and discretionary spending have led to a proliferation of public events, celebrations, and entertainment, making the events sector one of the fastest growing segments of tourism in the world. Countries and cities compete vigorously for mega events such as the Olympics, World Cup, and World Fairs. Societies are increasingly holding smaller scale events such as fairs, festivals, community markets, parades, or sporting events. Governments support and promote events as part of their strategies for economic development and destination marketing as these events serve as a means of creating awareness of a destination and enhancing visitation. Most events require considerable investments on planning and organisation to ensure the maximum possible benefit for all stakeholders. Inappropriate management can lead to negative economic, environmental, and social impacts. This course thus provides students with knowledge and skills required for planning, managing, and staging events to realise positive outcomes.
