Social media and advanced Web technologies, including generative AI tools (e.g. image recognition systems, automated audio-editors, and natural language generation software) have remarkably spurred the rise of digitally empowered consumers, challenging businesses to thrive on social media. In this digital era, consumers have gained a powerful voice, taking over online conversations by generating multimodal content across social media platforms (images, videos, audio, text, and emotional icons). Businesses striving to stay ahead of the competition leverage unstructured social media data to design and implement successful social media strategies.
In this course, we equip students with the necessary knowledge and competencies to collect and analyse unstructured social media data using recent technologies such as R, SAS Viya for text analytics, Social Network Analysis, Microsoft Azure AI Services and Google Vision AI.
Workshops are practical and designed to engage students in extensive hands-on activities and challenging case studies to develop their critical thinking and analytical skills to address real-life business problems. Upon successful completion of the course, students are expected to demonstrate both a professional perspective as well as technological confidence in social media analytics and its implications for the business context.
