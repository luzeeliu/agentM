How are algorithms and artificial intelligence changing the way we live and work, how we know and communicate, and even who we are? And what can we do about it? These are vital questions for anyone who wants to be a media agent for change, whether in your work, your community, or your daily life. Working with case studies from war, policing, education, consumption, logistics, and the workplace, this course gives you the knowledge you need to put new technologies like facial recognition under the microscope. You will develop your analytical skills by applying critical frameworks to understand big data, machine learning, computer vision, and remote sensors such as drones, and their cultural, social, and political impacts. You will also gain insight into alternative approaches to and activist interventions in algorithmic and AI systems, including First Nations, Black, and queer engagements. This course equips you to critique emerging media futures while also participating in building alternatives that are more just and equitable.
