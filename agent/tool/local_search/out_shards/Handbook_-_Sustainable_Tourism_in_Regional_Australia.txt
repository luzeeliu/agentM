This course offers an introduction to concepts and tools necessary for understanding the challenges of sustainable development in the transport-environment-tourism nexus. Students will develop skills in comprehending and assessing the environmental, social and economic sustainability of societal decisions in the context of tourism. A field excursion to Lady Elliott Island – located in the Southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef - will be undertaken with the objective of allowing students to develop an understanding of these societal trade-offs. The field-based learning will emphasise teamwork, as well as independent observational and enquiry skills using remote eco-resort as a context. Topics will include issues at the interface of transport and tourism management and sustainable development principles. Students will engage in preparatory learning leading up to the excursion, as well as reflective learning through assignments during- and post-trip. Around 24 hours of class, including education tours, fieldwork and presentations, are delivered on the island during the field excursion. This is a summer intensive course. Students should be aware that additional costs associated with the field trip will be incurred including return airfare to Lady Elliott Island (LEI), accommodation and food. This course is also available as AVIA3900.
