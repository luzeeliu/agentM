This is a capstone Chemical Engineering course involving the design of part or all of a process plant. You will work in a team to respond to a design brief developed in consultation with industry partners focusing on sustainability and the circular economy for real-world operations. Preparing your design will involve you applying and integrating your learning from the entire undergraduate Chemical Engineering stream involving technical, economic, environmental and societal considerations.
The project will involve you working through various phases of design according to professional expectations and industry standards. First, you will define the design problem, generate and evaluate conceptual products and/or processes, and prepare a preliminary design and costing. Then you will prepare detailed equipment selection and sizing, as well as developing a control system to manage hazards identified through your risk register and hazard and operability (HAZOP) study. Lastly, you will finalise process equipment and plant layout, evaluate and control environmental impacts, and evaluate the economic viability of the plant. Alongside the design work, you will apply and extend your professional skills and lifelong learning skills in team work, communication, decision making, leadership and project management.
