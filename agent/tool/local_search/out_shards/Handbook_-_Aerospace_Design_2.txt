This course is a capstone aerospace design project. In design teams, students develop a preliminary design of an aircraft to meet a given request for proposal. The course aims to give a holistic approach to the aerospace design process. Students are required to consider the requirements of several disciplines including conceptual design, configuration, weights, sizing, payload, aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, systems, stability and control, performance, and cost. The course will give students the opportunity to integrate these elements into a single congruous design of an aircraft. Teamwork, report writing, and presentation skills are a focus to develop important professional skills for industry.
Students are expected to have a sound understanding of aerospace regulations, aerodynamics, flight performance, propulsion, structural design and analysis, materials, computer aided design, flight dynamics, and aerospace systems prior to attempting this course.
