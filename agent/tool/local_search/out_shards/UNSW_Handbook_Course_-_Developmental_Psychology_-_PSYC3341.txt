Description
This is an advanced level course which provides an overview of theories and research in developmental psychology, with an emphasis on understanding how biological, cognitive, emotional, and social processes develop and interact. Specific topics may include prenatal growth, attention and memory, language development, cognitive development, development of attachments, moral development, and gender-role development. The implications of research in these areas for the understanding of emotional, intellectual and behavioural problems during childhood will be examined.
