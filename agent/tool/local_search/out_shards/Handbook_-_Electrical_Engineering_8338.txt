Postgraduate study in Electrical Engineering allows students to consolidate a specialisation degree, change direction to a new area of engineering or accelerate towards careers in R&D.
The Electrical Engineering specialisation is underpinned by the attainment of disciplinary and advanced disciplinary knowledge, and the undertaking of an enquiry-based learning component. This specialisation offers electives across several sub-disciplines of electrical engineering, allowing students the option of obtaining a good depth of knowledge in one discipline, or a breadth of knowledge by adopting a multidisciplinary approach when choosing their electives. The specialisation provides a solid postgraduate program for electrical engineers wishing to upgrade their skills or further their knowledge.
