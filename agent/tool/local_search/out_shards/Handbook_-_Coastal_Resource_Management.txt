This course focuses on coastal resource assessment and management and builds skills in science and policy-based solutions for coastal problems and issues. The course is designed for students aspiring to pursue a career as an environmental manager, environmental consultant or applied scientist. Case studies and topics on Australian coastal zone policy, coastal erosion and conservation, soil and water acidification, global aquaculture issues and management, causes of fish kills and fish disease outbreaks, estuary management, coastal water resource management, recreational and commercial fisheries and coastal wetlands are used to understand how science informs management. The course considers Australian and global perspectives on current and emerging coastal resource management issues. The course includes lectures, tutorials and a one-day field trip. Assignments build skills in writing ministerial advisories, management briefs, funding proposal writing, and production of a professional standard coastal management plan or management communication tool.
