Description
Recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of acute and chronic inflammation, infection, allergy and autoimmune diseases. Detailed discussion of mediators of these processes, including cytokines and growth factors. Systemic pathology of various organs and tissues, including the cardiovascular (e.g. coronary artery disease) and respiratory systems (e.g. asthma), with an emphasis on molecular pathogenesis. Laboratory classes introduce 'state-of-the-art' research and diagnostic techniques.
Note: Students are advised that previous and concurrent study of Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry or Immunology would be an advantage.
