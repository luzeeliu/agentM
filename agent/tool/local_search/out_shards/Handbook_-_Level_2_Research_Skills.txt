In this course, students will discover the university research environment by collaborating with peers and UNSW researchers on an authentic research project. Students can choose a disciplinary-focused or interdisciplinary project, across a broad range of fields in the Faculty of Science. Students will then be placed into a project group based on their preferences and availability.
Students will work independently and with their project group throughout the term and receive guidance and mentorship from active researchers with expertise in the project area.
To support skill development and peer connection across research groups, students will complete a self-paced online module and participate in a 1-hour interactive workshop each week. These activities provide guidance on how to complete the project milestones and assessments (e.g., literature review, video presentation), as well as introduce key skills and activities in academic research (e.g., ethics, data analysis and communicating results).
By completing this course, students will gain important research and transferable graduate skills that are highly valued across a range of graduate pathways and will prepare them for further research opportunities in their program.
