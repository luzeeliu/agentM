Economics is an influential social science that explores human behaviour and decision-making, with a focus on the roles played by incentives, resource constraints, laws, customs, and institutions. The Business Economics major will equip you to apply insights from economic theory, empirical studies and real-world data to understand the market-related, strategic, organisational, regulatory, political, and environmental issues faced by businesses and governments and to influence business practice and public policy. This flexible major allows you to shape your studies around your interests and goals and choose from a wide range of exciting courses.
Economists are keenly sought after by private sector employers, not-for-profits, policymakers at all levels of government, and international organisations. Economics graduates work in diverse careers as analysts, consultants, forecasters, advisors, researchers, and journalists. There is a strong market demand for business economists in Australia and overseas.
Business Economics offers a holistic understanding of the business world and has synergies with all other BCom majors, such as Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and Innovation, Strategy and Entrepreneurship.
You will learn from top experts in the field, developing practical analytical skills and future-proof critical thinking skills applicable to a changing professional landscape.
