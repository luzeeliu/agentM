This course introduces you to contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art by examining current practices and discourses and the histories and theories that shape them. Focused through a series of specific artist case studies, the course aims to facilitate rigorous discussion and analysis of contemporary First Nations' art in Australia as well as its intersections with complex and diverse social, cultural, political, and artistic contexts.
