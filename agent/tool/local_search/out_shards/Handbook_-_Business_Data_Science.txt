Business Data Sciences is the study of methods for organising, modelling and analysing large and complex data relevant for businesses, governments or other organisations. The information gleaned from the data analysis is intended to improve business decisions and inform policies.
The program provides a strong technical background in mathematics, statistics, computer science and economics. The Business Data Science major enables a student to specialise further in econometrics and business applications and to choose from electives across economics and business disciplines as well as specialised courses in mathematics, statistics and computer science.
The program and this major open a pathway to exciting careers in data science with applications to economics and business. Any organisation interested in insights from data about consumer choices, online searches and numerous other monitored or surveyed activities requires a team to model and analyse this data and to inform evidence-based decisions and policies.
