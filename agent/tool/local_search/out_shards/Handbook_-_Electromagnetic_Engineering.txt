Electromagnetism has fundamental importance to several engineering fields and its theories are indispensable in understanding electro-mechanical energy conversion, transmission, electric power, communication systems, RF/microwave devices, optical fibre systems, antennas, remote sensing, radio astronomy, and electromagnetic compatibility. This course will consider electromagnetic theory as a general theory that includes the standard electro and magneto-statics. The relationship between electric and magnetic fields, and their links expressed through the Maxwell equations which then lead to wave propagation with associated wave behaviours. The course covers several aspects of electromagnetic applications such as capacitance and inductance formation, electromagnetic induction, forces and power losses in electromagnetic systems (at low frequencies) and transmission lines, impendence matching circuits, waveguides, and antennas (at high frequencies). This course aims to give students the necessary background for the design and analysis of both low frequency electrical devices and high-frequency electronic components. Assumed knowledge for this course includes undergraduate physics (PHYS1231), vector calculus (MATH2069), and basic circuit theory techniques.
