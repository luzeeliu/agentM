There is increasing need in generating electricity from renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are one of the few distributed renewable electricity generation options that can be readily used in urban areas (as grid connected systems) and in remote areas (as off-grid systems), with little environmental impact at the site and potential economic benefits for the user and the network operator. PV systems are also part of the sustainable solution required in centralised energy plants (solar farms).
The PV industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, growing at an accelerating rate due to the cost and efficiency improvements achieved in the last twenty years, thanks in part to important contributions by UNSW researchers and alumni. The industry needs to grow at an even faster rate if the world is to meet its targets in carbon emission reductions. The challenge now is to achieve terawatts of capacity installed every year around the world!
The aim of the course is to provide students with tools and information on the technical and economic issues with respect to the design, installation, and operation of photovoltaic energy systems. In particular, the course aims to develop students’ design, problem solving, and communication skills to implement PV systems in accordance to Australian Standards.
