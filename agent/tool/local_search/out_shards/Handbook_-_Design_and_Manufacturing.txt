Have you ever wondered how devices and machines are manufactured with such precision? Have you pondered over the manufacturing process involved in creating robotic movements and appendages? All of this is possible due to fundamental machining methods. Without understanding the physical construction of our designs, it is impossible to create successful prototypes and products.
In this course, you will learn how to create graphical outputs such as 3D models and engineering drawings that facilitate design solutions. Additionally, you will acquire the skills necessary to take your computer-aided design (CAD) model from the virtual world and machine it on a computer numerical control (CNC) machine. By the end of the term, you will have the skills and knowledge to marvel at your own machined creation.
