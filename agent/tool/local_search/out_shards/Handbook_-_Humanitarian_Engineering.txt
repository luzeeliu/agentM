Engineers have always sought to solve problems efficiently and creatively. Graduates completing the Humanitarian Engineering minor are engineers who can address problems in disadvantaged communities and societies around the world. The Humanitarian Engineering minor will let you combine your skills as an Engineer with skills in humanitarian practice to address problems relating to inequities and lack-of-access to essential services in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Sendai Framework and international humanitarian relief efforts. Students complete a humanitarian fundamentals core as well as Development Studies elective to provide them with the context and key principles, and then extend this in their choice of another elective and a self-chosen project course. Students are strongly encouraged to approach the Minor convener with a proposal for their 4th year thesis topic if they are considering deepening their humanitarian project into a larger research project, or if they wish to substitute another project for ENGG4102. There are a number of
VIP projects
that can be substituted for the project or elective requirement for the Minor. Students who are completing the Humanitarian Engineering Minor and who are also enrolled in a VIP project should contact the Minor convenor to see if their VIP course can count towards the minor.
The 24 uoc of courses required for the Minor can be course shared with courses taken for other program requirements.
Completion of the minor will require suitable choice of discipline electives within their stream. Students in dual degrees are not likely to have space within their program requirements to complete the minor. Some streams do not offer electives that overlap with those required for the Humanitarian Engineering minor:
Students completing the following majors can complete the minor within their program requirements
Chemical Engineering
Chemical Product Engineering
Civil Engineering
Photovoltaics and Solar Energy
Students completing the following majors can complete the minor only if their Thesis or another required project course is on a Humanitarian topic and is approved as a substitute for ENGG4102
Environmental Engineering
Aerospace Engineering
Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering
Students completing the following majors cannot complete the minor within their program requirements. Some streams may be eligible to complete the minor where course substitution is approved by their Program and Stream Authority.

Mechatronic Engineering
Mining Engineering

Note:
- With approval of the minor stream authority, a student may substitute ENGG4102 Humanitarian Engineering Project only with another suitable humanitarian project/thesis topic completed elsewhere (e.g. Thesis or Project Course). Where a 12uoc Thesis is substituted, only 6uoc counts towards the minor, in place of  ENGG4102. Please contact the Humanitarian Engineering minor coordinator to seek approval for a substitution.
- ENGG3001 Fundamentals of Humanitarian Engineering is considered to be an interdisciplinary course in this minor
