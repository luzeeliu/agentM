This course explores the intersection of User Experience (UX) design and public policy, providing students with a unique opportunity to apply UX research methods to complex societal challenges. Throughout the course, students will engage with real-world social policy documents and analyse them through a human-centred design lens. By conducting stakeholder interviews, synthesising research insights, and developing actionable solutions, students will learn how UX principles can inform policy improvements that better serve diverse communities.
A key focus of this course is exposing future UX designers to the evolving role of design in shaping society. As the scope of UX expands, it is crucial for designers to anticipate future directions for the field, including its application in the public sector. By working on complex, high-stakes issues such as healthcare, education, and housing policies, students will hone their research and design skills while also grappling with ethical and societal considerations.
Through hands-on research, prototyping, and iterative design processes, students will not only develop practical UX skills but also deepen their understanding of the broader impact of design on public life. This course aims to equip future UX professionals with the tools to create meaningful, human-centred solutions that address the pressing challenges of tomorrow.
Note: The code for this course was previously SDES9315.
