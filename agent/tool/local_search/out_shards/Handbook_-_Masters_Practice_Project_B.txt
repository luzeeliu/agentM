CVEN9051 forms the second part of the Coursework Thesis program, and is completed in the semester after the completion of CVEN9050 Thesis A. In preparing your thesis topic in Thesis B for CVEN9051 you are able to select and nominate a Civil and/or Environmental Engineering topic that is of significant interest to you. Your topic may be associated with core elements such as Structural Design, Water and Hydraulics, Geotechnical Engineering, Transportation, Construction or Sustainability. Within Thesis B there are also project management elements that engineering professionals would be required to address and these elements will be incorporated as part of the Thesis B submission. This will enable all students to develop understanding of how their work impacts upon others and will allow them to identify the key communication pathways that are required to be addressed in the development of engineering solutions being offered. Consider the utility of your thesis topic in terms of your future career, either by re-inforcing and presenting your skills in a chosen field, or by experiencing and developing capabilities in a new area. Your thesis is a requirement for your degree, however it also presents an opportunity to explore areas of interest and demonstrate expertise when advancing in your profession As the course will involve several submissions throughout the semester, Thesis B will be completed incrementally with guidance provided at each stage.
