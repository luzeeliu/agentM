In this course, you will gain knowledge and skills in planning, economics and investment within electricity industries that are pursuing clean energy transition, including deploying growing levels of variable renewables as well as distributed energy resources. We'll cover the evolving electricity industry drivers of market restructuring, technological developments and environmental concerns, and their impact on power system planning and investment. You'll learn conventional approaches and tools for characterising electricity industry technology options and solving optimal generation and network investment planning with traditional utility industry structures. However, we'll also cover planning and investment within restructured electricity industries with wholesale spot electricity markets, bilateral trading, derivatives and full retail competition. You'll gain knowledge and skills to help drive clean energy transition in electricity sectors around the world.
