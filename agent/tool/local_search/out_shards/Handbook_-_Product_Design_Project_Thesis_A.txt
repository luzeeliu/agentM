Design and creative development are the engine of growth for economies and industry product portfolios. Chemical products touch consumers the world over, delivering innovations in pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, cosmetics, and foods.
This is the first course of the two-course product research and design project sequence.
In this course, you will begin exploring global corporate innovations through case studies and active working groups, map consumer and market need to develop an intellectual property strategy and development plan for a novel consumer product. Designing and delivering new products to market is a complex process. It involves open-ended problems that demand creativity, reflection, and quantitative analysis of results. These problems can have multiple correct approaches and that will require you to demonstrate your expertise through the practice of innovation, creativity and authoritative judgement. Industry partners will work with you to explore, create, and assess your product as it develops.
Whether you’re interested in developing new innovations for existing companies or for your own entrepreneurial efforts, you will gain confidence and independence that will enable you to make real contributions to the global economy.
You will continue and complete your project in CEIC4008 Product Design Project Thesis B.
