Description
This course examines research and theory on memory and motivation as they underpin adaptive behaviour. The focus is primarily on animal research but the application of this work to the understanding of memory and motivation in humans will be made explicit. For example, the implications of this work for our understanding of memory disorders in humans, and the origin and treatment of clinical disorders will be discussed.
