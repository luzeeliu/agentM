This course will deal with the major topics of engineering geology and groundwater controls on surface mining slope stability in the form of discontinuities, variable materials and pore pressures; effect of excavation method and scheduling in pit stability; the fundamental basis of stability analysis; advantages and disadvantages of a range of mathematical models; remedial measures that can be taken to stabilise slopes; pit slope design in the context of overall mine planning. In addition to dealing with the underlying principles, the course may involve workshops and field inspections so that the participants gain hands-on experience of practical cases.
