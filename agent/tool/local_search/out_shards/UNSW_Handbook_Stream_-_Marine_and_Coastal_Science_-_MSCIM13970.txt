Stream Outline
Marine and Coastal Science looks at all aspects of the marine environment, encompassing many sciences from biology to geology. Within the School of BEES, Marine and Coastal Science can be studied with an emphasis on biology, earth sciences or oceanography. Marine Biologists look at life on the shore and in the oceans and estuaries, whereas Marine Geologists study the structure and topography of the ocean floor, ocean sedimentation and marine resources.
