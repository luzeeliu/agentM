The project is an inquiry-based learning course that allows a team of students to combine engineering principles learned over their previous years of study and professional experience and apply them to innovatively solve problems, such as developing a specific design or process and/or investigating a hypothesis. Projects can take many forms, such as the design and construction of experimental equipment or a theoretical investigation.
The projects that students undertake are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for their creativity and the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of results. There are multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning from the students. The project requires students to formulate problems in scientific or engineering terms, manage a technical project and find solutions by applying scientific and engineering methods.
This is the second course in the two-course project structure, carried out over two consecutive terms. Apart from exceptional circumstances, students should continue with the same supervisor and project they had in the first course, ELEC9771.
