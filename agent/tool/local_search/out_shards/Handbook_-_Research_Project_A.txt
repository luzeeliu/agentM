The course is for high achievers who can and want to maximise the kind of experience in research that a Masters by coursework can expose students to. It exceeds the aims of COMP9900 in doing more than "putting everything together": it aims at letting students tackle a genuine piece of research and improve on the state of the art, be it by making an algorithm more effective, or combining algorithms in new ways, or applying and adjusting particular techniques to new problems. Though projects can be purely theoretical, most projects will be applied at least to some extent and they will have an experimental component, thanks to which it is often possible to compare the proposed approach with existing ones.
By the end of the term, students must give a seminar, inviting at least supervisor and assessor, with a presentation that is roughly 45 minutes long, during which they review the topic, including current approaches, plan for future work, and demonstrate they have made progress towards carrying out that plan. The presentation is followed by questions and answers, for a total of roughly an hour.
A mark of less than 75 will not allow students to follow up with either COMP9992 or COMP9993; instead, they will have to enrol in COMP9900.
A mark of at least 75 but less than 85 will allow students to enrol in COMP9992 but not in COMP9993; they will still have the option to instead enrol in COMP9900 if they wish.
A mark of at least 85 will allow students to enrol in COMP9993; they will still have the option to instead enrol in COMP9900 or COMP9992 if they wish.
Students will only be able to score at least 85 if the seminar has demonstrated that the work expected to successfully conduct the research is equivalent to completing 2 standard courses; if students eligible to enrol in COMP9993 prefer to enrol in COMP9992, the supervisor should first confirm that the project can be downsized so it becomes equivalent to completing 1 standard course; would that modification of the project not be possible, a student who is not keen to follow up with COMP9993 would have to enrol in COMP9900.
