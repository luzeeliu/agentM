This course complements PSYC4093 Psychology 4A as part of the compulsory coursework requirement of the Honours Program in Psychology. PSYC4103 is split into a core component and an elective component.
The core component is taken by all students and comprises a weekly 2-hour lecture (Weeks 1-9) and 1 hour tutorial (Weeks 1-9. The core component takes a scientist-practitioner approach, linking real world problems faced by organisational, forensic and clinical psychologists with empirically-supported interventions. It develops deep understanding of psychological testing, including the theoretical and empirical bases underpinning the construction, implementation, and interpretation of some of the more widely used cognitive and personality assessments. The course also develops foundational skills in the ethical use of psychological tests and foundational knowledge and skills in interviewing and counseling.
The elective component is delivered in a seminar mode with students split into smaller groups. Each elective stream engages students with a contemporary topic and consists of a weekly 2-hour seminar (Weeks 1-9 or 2-10).
