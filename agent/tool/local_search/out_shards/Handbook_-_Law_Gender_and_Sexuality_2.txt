This course explores the way the law shapes, and is shaped by, legal responses to gender and sexuality. It draws from feminist and queer theory to analyse the operation of the law in general, and in areas specific to gender and sexuality concerns. We explore these tensions across a range of domestic, foreign, and international jurisdictions. Topics covered in the course vary according to current debates in the field, but include: feminist and queer legal theory; anti-discrimination law; privacy law; health law; the relationships between gendered and queer identities and criminal law; law and intersectional identities; and the legal pathways to political power for people disenfranchised on account of their gender and / or sexuality.
