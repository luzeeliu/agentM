Interior Architecture Practice Studio 8 focuses on the second phase of detailed design and resolution of the final design project, culminating in a cohesive and comprehensive design response.
This studio builds on the design propositions developed in Design Practice 7: Propose. Using the design proposition developed in the Investigation phase, you will then work on detailed design development and resolution of a number of key spaces and elements within the scheme, incorporating work from all phases in a final presentation. The outcome from this studio is a rigorous, inventive and professional design proposal which includes documentation of design research, design process and the developed design. This course is educationally sequenced alongside all other year four IA (Hons) courses.
