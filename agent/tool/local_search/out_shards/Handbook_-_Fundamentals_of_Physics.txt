This is an introductory level course in physics for students from all disciplines. The course has both a laboratory and theoretical component. Topics covered include the description of motion; forces and momentum; the dynamics of particles; kinetic and potential energy; the conservation of energy; oscillations and simple harmonic motion; waves, wave reflection, refraction and interference; the wave nature of light; electric fields and charge; electric potential and energy; electric currents; magnetism; electromagnetic induction and Faraday's law. This is a quantitative course using algebra and trigonometry but not calculus.
Note: There is no Assumed Knowledge for this course. It also serves as a suitable introduction to Physics for students whose Program requires them to take PHYS1121 or PHYS1131 but who do not have the recommended level of Assumed Knowledge for these courses.
