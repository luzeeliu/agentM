Driven by rapid technological progress in areas that range from genetic engineering to super-resolution microscopy, both the fidelity and precision of contemporary biology is increasing year on year. To go hand in hand with this, a quantitative understanding of the underlying physics, as well as corresponding skills in analysis and modelling play an increasingly important role in modern scientific practice.  BIOP2001 will introduce you to several notions that are central to biophysics, with the aim of providing a quantitative foundation for advanced topics in biology. Emphasis will be placed on physical concepts, and their role in understanding biological processes. These include, but are not limited to: information theory, thermodynamics, systems biology, kinetics, diffusion, phase separation, and membranes. Integrated practical classes and tutorials will develop data analysis skills and reinforce the link between biological processes and their physical underpinnings, through wet lab and computational sessions.
