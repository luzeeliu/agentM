Planning Practice: Ethics and Expertise is one of five courses designed to support your practice year. As a suite, these courses will provoke you to draw upon your own experiences to think more critically about the planning sector’s competing objectives and inform your development as a planning professional. In each of these courses you will bring real world examples of the opportunities and challenges of your professional placement into the classroom, and learn from the diversity of other students’ experiences, to integrate insights across theory and practice.
In this course, Planning Practice: Ethics and Expertise you will interrogate the challenges of maintaining professional standards through conduct and accountability, consistency, discretion, transparency and rigour. Building on this ethical perspective, you will reflect on how best to navigate public and private interests, current affairs and political debates that affect your work. You will discuss your professional contributions, consider the contributions of the professions you work closely with and the importance of confidently using data, evidence, and analytical acumen to inform your work.
