Description
Development of skills in applying statistics to biological, earth and spatial data; design and analysis of experiments in life and earth sciences; sampling strategies for estimating sample size; analysis of community and environment structure using multivariate statistics; simulation modelling in population biology, and statistical fitting of non-linear models to population growth data; correlation and both simple and multiple regression; improving statistical models using analysis of residuals; analysis of spatial data.
Examples are drawn from ecological, geographical, earth, behavioural, genetic, microbial and immunological data. Practical work emphasises problem-solving and hands-on experience with EXCEL, MINITAB and other specialist software.
