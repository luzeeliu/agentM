This course covers strategic transport network planning aspects related to urban transport systems, including network-based analysis, modelling and optimisation techniques. Network representation of transport systems and traffic route choice modelling including user equilibrium and system optimal are the two main broad topics that will be discussed in this subject. Knowledge about different types of transport network solutions and when and where to apply them are important for transport modelling professionals. The subject material focuses on network theory in some depth, and a reasonable mathematical competency, as well as the ability to perform computational work, will be required to follow this subject. Computer literacy will be helpful but is not essential.
