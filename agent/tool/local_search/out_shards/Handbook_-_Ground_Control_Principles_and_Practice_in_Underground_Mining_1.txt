Overview
This course explores the principles of rock reinforcement and ground support in underground excavations, focusing on the interaction between mining methods, excavation layouts, and reinforcement systems. You will learn about active and passive support mechanisms, support requirements for different excavation types, ground reaction curves, and load- and displacement-controlled support responses.… For more content click the Read More button below.
This course explores the principles of rock reinforcement and ground support in underground excavations, focusing on the interaction between mining methods, excavation layouts, and reinforcement systems. You will learn about active and passive support mechanisms, support requirements for different excavation types, ground reaction curves, and load- and displacement-controlled support responses.
The course also covers various ground support and reinforcement hardware, support system design, installation procedures, quality assurance, and time-dependent effects on support performance, including remedial options. A key focus is on risk-based ground support systems and their integration into ground control management, ensuring students understand how to optimise safety and stability in underground environments. Understanding ground support is critical for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and longevity of underground mining operations.
This course equips you with the knowledge and practical insights needed to design, implement, and manage effective support systems in diverse geotechnical conditions, making it essential for those pursuing careers in mining, tunnelling, or geotechnical engineering.
