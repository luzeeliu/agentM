Financial Technology (FinTech) is a rapidly growing field in finance where technology enhances and reimagines financial services, resulting in disruptive changes. The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), wealth management (Big Data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning) and advisory services (robo-advisers), banking (payday loans and peer-to-peer lending), trading tools (high-frequency trading), and decentralized finance (of which cryptocurrency and blockchain technology form the foundation). Established financial services firms and technology companies both demand talent in this space, as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.
Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this specialisation introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms,
Students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.

Course Sharing for Double Specialisations
keyboard_arrow_down
Students who complete two specialisations that share a common Foundation Core Course (COMMKS and ECONFS, FINSCS and FINSQS, or MARKGS and MARKTS) must take an additional 6 UOC of Electives or Capstone Courses. These students are strongly recommended to choose another specialisation course as their additional Elective.
For example, in Finance and Financial Technology where FINS5512 are requirements for both specialisations, students are recommended to complete an additional specialisation core elective course – e.g. FINS5510/FINS5530 or FINS5545/FINS5546/FINS5547/FINS5548.
