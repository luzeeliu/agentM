This course is presented in two parts: Sustainability Governance and Regulation, and Sustainability Reporting.
Leaders and managers must understand their obligations to the long-term financial health of the organisations they lead and therefore must also understand their requirements to manage for sustainable outcomes and to report performance.
In order to achieve this, leaders and managers must understand key global and national sustainability policies, standards and frameworks, and ensure that the management of material sustainability issues is well integrated into their governance structures, strategies and business models, and risk-management practices.
This is critical to ensuring that managers can set, operationalise and implement their organisations’ sustainability commitments, demonstrate and publicly report sustainability performance, and avoid greenwashing and the risk of failing to deliver on their commitments.
