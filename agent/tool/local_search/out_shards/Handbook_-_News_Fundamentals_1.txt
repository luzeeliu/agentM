This course develops skills in the practice of news reporting as it operates widely across different domains of journalism. You will develop skills not only in the reporting of current-affairs and sports news as traditionally undertaken by newspapers and broadcast news departments, but also in the reporting of news in, for example, music, arts, travel, fashion and motoring journalism. The course will focus on skills associated with all stages of the news reporting process, and you will develop your knowledge of how potential news items are selected, how journalists manage relationships with “contacts” and how they conduct interviews. Obviously, there will also be a focus on news writing itself – the verbal styles and structures employed in news reporting of different types, and the skills required to distil sometimes complex material into a form which will attract and hold the attention of casual readers. Basic photojournalistic skills will also be covered.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
