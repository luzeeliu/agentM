Are you preparing for a career in medicine or health, or simply keen to learn about how our bodies function in health and disease? Human Systems 2 builds on the concepts introduced in Human Systems 1 and will enable you to further appreciate the relationship between anatomical structures and physiological functions of the human body. You will investigate the relationships between normal structure and function in human cells, tissues, and organs, and how this applies to health maintenance, ageing and disease. The Human Systems 2 course content is divided into modules: Respiratory, Urinary, Digestive, Endocrine and Reproductive Systems. Alongside learning about these systems in the human body, you will also develop skills in research, critical analysis, and communication of scientific information relevant to the study of medicine and health.
