An airport is an extensive system of inter-related and finely balanced subsystems. If any of the subsystems are out of balance, airport users, airlines, aircraft operators and their passengers experience delays and inconvenience. In addition, any disruptions to the system have directly negative financial implications. To ensure optimal performance, the airport system and its subsystems need to be planned for an appropriate future time horizon.
This course will provide a broad understanding of the key elements of Airport Planning and foster skills in taking a realistic view when faced with an airport planning situation, of what the process can achieve and what constraints must be considered across the various parts of aviation industry.
This fully online course uses real life aviation examples and is taught by an industry expert. It explores concepts including town planning, access, obstacles, growth, and issues relating to environment, politics and ownership as airports become privatised. The course will cover topics including privatisation and investment evaluation, community benefits, airport master plans, forecasting aircraft movements and passenger and freight flows, terminal planning issues, runway and taxiway planning. Students will also have the opportunity to test their understanding through assessments that draw on the concepts explored in the case studies.
