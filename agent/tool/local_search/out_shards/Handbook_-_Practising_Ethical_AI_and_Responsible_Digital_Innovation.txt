This Level 3 course takes a deep dive into the societal impact of digital technologies, tackling the “wicked problems” that come with technological advancements – such as digital surveillance and exclusion. Students will explore the digital landscape through a critical lens, learning to weigh the unintended consequences of technology alongside the benefits of digital innovation.
Throughout the course, students will engage with the latest Information Systems (IS) research, tools, and methodologies to better understand and navigate the complex intersections of technology, organisations, and society. With a strong focus on the responsible management of emerging technologies – including artificial intelligence – the course brings in real-world industry perspectives and projects, offering hands-on experience in tackling pressing challenges in digital technology management. Students will critically evaluate both the benefits and risks of digital technologies, develop inclusive strategies, and implement responsible practices that enhance societal well-being and protect individual rights.
By the end of the course, students will have the skills and knowledge to lead responsibly in digital innovation, ensuring technology serves society as a whole. Learning takes place through a mix of interactive seminars, research-driven discussions, and project-based collaborations, providing a dynamic environment where students can apply theoretical insights to real-world scenarios.
