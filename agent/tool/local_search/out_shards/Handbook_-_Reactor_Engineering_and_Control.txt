This course integrates in-depth knowledge of neutron physics and thermohydraulics to examine the complexities of reactor dynamics, control theory, and the safety protocols essential for the safe operation of a nuclear reactor. Students will be introduced to linear control system theory, employing block diagrams and frequency analysis to model the reactor's state, stability, and optimal design. Practical experience will be gained through the operation of a reactor simulator, demonstrating the impact of reactor design and operator actions on the reactor's response. Students completing this course will be able to confidently address the challenges of reactor system control by comprehending, configuring, and utilizing the feedback mechanisms inherent within a nuclear reactor.
