In this course, you will develop an appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge, culture and tradition, specifically as they relate to land and waters. You will gain a practical understanding of how to engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities to better understand their rights and interests, the importance of their connections to their country and how that may be integrated into contemporary land use and environmental planning. You will examine how the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples applies to the context of planning and explore models of implementation of property rights that promote equitable, just, and culturally relevant economic and social development. Considering the relevance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ knowledge and culture to contemporary planning and planning practice, this course will give you a unique opportunity to contextualise and interpret Indigenous policy.
