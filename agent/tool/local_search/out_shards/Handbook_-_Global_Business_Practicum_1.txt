This course is designed to enable postgraduate students to gain international understanding, exposure and workplace skills through studying and working in a specified location outside Australia. Examples of locations include Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, India and South Korea.
Structure:
Prior to departure students undertake preparatory workshops in skills development and cultural context for the country they will be visiting. These workshops include topics such as professionalism; reporting and other professional writing and communication skills; expectations during the practicum; cultural understanding; and “getting to know” other team members.
While in the designated country, students will work in a local organisation for a minimum of 2 weeks full-time (70-80 hrs). Acting as consultants to the client organisation, teams of 4-5 students will work on a business issue provided by the client organisation. Students will be supported by an academic and will attend master classes, provided by local leaders of business and government organisations, to understand the conduct of business in this local context.
After returning to Australia, students will attend a debrief session, and complete the major assessment.
Further details can be found on the Career Accelerator website.
