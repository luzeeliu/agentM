This course focuses on investigating changes in Earth’s systems, with an emphasis on measuring the chemistry and modelling the movement of air and water.
To support the energy, food and material needs of modern societies humans have had an impact on almost all ecosystems on Earth. In this course students learn how to measure the impacts of past, current, and proposed human activities and how to collect the data required to determine how to sustainably manage our Earth. Students learn how to: measure greenhouse gas emissions and identify mitigation opportunities; measure water quality, determine its origin, and manage surface and ground water supplies; monitor the atmosphere and water resources using ground-, aircraft- and satellite-based analysers.
Each week consists of 3 hours of online learning material and a 3-hour laboratory.
There are no prerequisites for the course, but background knowledge of the Earth Sciences and chemistry would be helpful. This course provides the skills required to work for environmental consulting or carbon management companies or pursue research careers in environmental science.
The skills gained from this course contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
