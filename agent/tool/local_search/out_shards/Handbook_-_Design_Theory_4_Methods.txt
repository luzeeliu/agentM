The course introduces a range of established Industrial Design research methods. These are methods in which students will apply some rigour to activities such as observation of user behaviours, simulation of Industrial Design alternatives, and analysis of available information. Lectures, case studies and online resources will provide a theoretical platform for students, but learning will include application, practice and reflective discussion of methods in Industrial Design challenges.
The focus is on developing rigour around academic research skills and writing within the context of Industrial Design research. Students will be given a list of specific topics to choose from to start their Industrial Design research process. The term will culminate with a Industrial Design Research Report, covering problems and/or opportunities identified for the selected topic, a literature review, data gathering, synthesis and analysis of information and research results.
