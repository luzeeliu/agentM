Electrochemical energy storage is the most widely applied clean energy technology in this age and will be the central focus in this course. However, the course will also cover other energy storage technologies with equivalent importance in different fields of application, such as chemical storage, thermal storage, mechanical storage and biomass energy. Students will learn the basic principles of electrochemical technologies in energy storage engineering: rechargeable batteries, flow batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, electrolysers, photo-electrochemical reactions, etc. Students will also be introduced to system integration and energy economy in the context of sustainability.
