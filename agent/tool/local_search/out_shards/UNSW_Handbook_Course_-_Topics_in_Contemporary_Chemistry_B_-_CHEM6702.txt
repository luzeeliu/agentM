Description
Topics in Contemporary Chemistry B is a premier lecture course run by the School of Chemistry. The course runs in session 2 and can be taken as a stand alone course or as a complement to CHEM6701 (the session 1 partner to this course). The course will emphasise some of the latest advances in chemistry, including several topics based on current research directions within the School. Students will study three topics. The topics will vary depending on availability and will differ from, and complement, those offered in the preceding CHEM6701 course. Indicative topic areas include: Advanced NMR, polymer chemistry, organometallic chemistry, supramolecular and macromolecular chemistry, heterocyclic chemistry, photochemical processes, advanced catalysis, f-block chemistry, kinetics, physical organic chemistry, computational methods, and biosynthesis. Students should check with the course coordinator which topics will be offered; assumed knowledge may differ depending on the topics offered.
