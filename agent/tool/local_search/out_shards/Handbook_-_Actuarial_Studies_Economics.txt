Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 192 UOC.
These UOC are made up of:
Actuarial Studies (96 UOC)
Level 1 Core Courses (48 UOC)
Level 2 Core Courses (24 UOC) (ACTL2131 may be substituted by MATH2901 and MATH2931, please see below)
Level 3 Core Course (6 UOC)
Level 3 Actuarial Studies Electives (18 UOC)
Economics (96 UOC)
Introductory Business Core (6 UOC)  - this will be satisfied by the completion of Level 1 Courses in the Actuarial Studies component.
Economics Core Courses (48 UOC) -  Students will complete ECON1101 & ECON1102 as part of the Actuarial Studies Level 1 Core Courses. Also ECON1202 and ECON1203 are satisfied by MATH1151 and MATH1251 and therefore students do not have to take these courses where listed in their major.
Economics Electives (30 UOC)
Business School Electives (12 UOC) – this will be satisfied by the completion of Level 2 and Level 3 courses in the Actuarial Studies component
Students may choose to use their Economics core and elective courses to complete an optional Economics major. Courses for the major are taken once but also meet core and elective course rules where listed.
Electives
Where students satisfy the requirements for the Actuarial and Economics rules in less than 192 UOC due to courses shared across the two programs, they can choose free electives to ensure a total of 192 UOC is completed.
