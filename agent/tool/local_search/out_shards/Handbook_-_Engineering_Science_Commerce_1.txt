The Master of Engineering Science/Master of Commerce double degree is ideal for you if you are an early or mid-career professional seeking to advance your career.
The Master of Commerce is innovative, industry-relevant and incorporates the latest thinking in business. The Master of Engineering Science is designed for engineers and graduates wishing to develop and expand their knowledge and skills in their current area of expertise. This will enable you to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards and to provide opportunities for continuing professional development, as well as the opportunity to interact with those at the cutting edge of their discipline. Both components allow you to specialise, choosing from a range of disciplines, to pursue your career ambitions.
This program allows you to graduate with both Masters after three years, with students with advanced standing able to complete their studies up to a year and a half sooner.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 144 UOC.
Master of Engineering Science (96 UOC)
An Engineering Science Specialisation (96 UOC)
Master of Commerce (72 UOC)
One Specialisation:
COMM5999 (0 UOC)
MGMT5050 (6 UOC)
Data analysis course (6 UOC)
Specialisation (24 UOC)
Electives (30 UOC) - 12 UOC of Engineering courses will be counted as Commerce electives (see double counting rules below), and students will complete a further 18 UOC of Business electives.
Capstone course (6 UOC)
Two Specialisations:
Students are recommended to take only one Master of Commerce specialisation to adhere to the UOC for their program. Students taking a second Master of Commerce specialisation will exceed the UOC for their program by at least 6 UOC.
COMM5999 (0 UOC)
MGMT5050 (6 UOC)
Data analysis course (6 UOC)
Specialisation 1 (24 UOC)
Specialisation 2 (24 UOC)
Electives (12 UOC) - 12 UOC of Engineering courses will be counted as Commerce electives (see double counting rules below)
Capstone course (6 UOC)
Double Counting Rules
In this double degree students take 96 UOC for the Master of Engineering Science and 72 UOC for the Master of Commerce, for a total of 168 UOC. Because some postgraduate courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 144 UOC.
Up to 24 UOC can be double counted towards the requirements of both programs, as follows:
MGMT5050 (6 UOC) in the Master of Commerce can be double counted as GSOE9510 (6 UOC), an Engineering Technical  Management course in the Master of Engineering Science.
12 UOC of Advanced Disciplinary Core Courses in the Master of Engineering Science can be double counted as 12 UOC of Elective courses outside of the UNSW Business School in the Master of Commerce.
6 UOC from the Capstone course in the Master of Commerce can be double counted as GSOE9220, GSOE9010 or GSOE9011 (6 UOC) in the Master of Engineering Science.
