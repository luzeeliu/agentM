In-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) — the concept of using local materials in space to support human activity - is widely recognised as one of the most transformative ideas for the future of space exploration. It underpins the emerging field of space mining, which has so far primarily focused on overcoming engineering challenges. Many scientists agree that, in the near future, we may begin extracting resources from off-Earth bodies such as asteroids, comets, the Moon, Mars, and its moons. These celestial bodies represent some of the most distant and untapped sources of materials ever considered for human use. For humanity to establish a sustained presence in deep space, including potential colonisation, it will be essential to produce key materials and products locally - making ISRU a critical enabler of space settlement. To succeed, space mining operations will need to function autonomously or be remotely operated from orbiting stations, spacecraft, or Earth. The uncertainties and technical challenges involved are significant and will require the development of new knowledge and capabilities. As a result, mining expertise will play a central role in enabling ISRU, and engineers will need to acquire new or specialised skills to meet the demands of this frontier.
In this course, students will be taken through the engineering lifecycle of new technologies and encouraged to think about how their unique skills can be applied to these projects. The course aims to provide information on space resources, develop a knowledge of technical and business risks and develop a scoping study for space mining operations. The course will be in short course format (5 days) including a series of lectures from research and industry experts, tutorials, and individual and group projects.
