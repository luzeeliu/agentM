Description
Short theoretical or experimental research project, supervised by a member of academic
staff. The internship may encompass project planning, literature review, project
development, fieldwork, experimental work, statistical analyses and oral and written
reporting. Internships may also involve ‘placements’ outside UNSW, in the form of
externally funded research programs, industrial placements or other programs either
during usual session or in the session breaks. In these cases students will require an
academic member of staff to supervise the internship.
Note: This course is restricted to Advanced Science students. Enrolment in this course is
by invitation and subject to availability of places: interested students should contact a
suitable supervisor and the Director of Teaching in the relevant School.
