In this work integrated learning experience, you will apply and extend your theoretical knowledge and practical research, communication and collaboration skills in a professional environment. You will be placed with a research institute, an international organisation, a non-government organisation, or a government agency in a part-time capacity (usually one day per week for 10 weeks). During this time, you will complete a research project negotiated with your workplace supervisor. Successful completion of the internship is dependent on the fulfilment of a contract that will be jointly negotiated between the internship director, workplace supervisor and you, the student. Your work placement will be supplemented with workshops at UNSW that offer you an opportunity to reflect on your professional placement and the institutional practices, policies, and processes you encounter.
