This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The minor specialisation in Advanced French Studies enables you to study French beginning at the Advanced or Professional entry level. You will not only develop your knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.
