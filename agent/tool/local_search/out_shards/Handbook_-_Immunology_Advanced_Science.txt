Immunology is a branch of biomedical science that studies the function of the immune system which protects us from infections. Immunology also includes the study of disorders of the immune system that contribute to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, allergies and some cancers. The discipline of Immunology is also critical in the development of diagnostic tests, novel treatments of disease and vaccines against infections including COVID-19.
This specialisation provides an advanced understanding of immunology, pathology and microbiology and will be beneficial to students wishing to pursue careers as biomedical researchers, hospital-scientists and laboratory technicians involved in the diagnosis of disease, development of immunotherapies and clinical trials. The specialisation would also be highly valuable for students who wish to pursue postgraduate medicine.
