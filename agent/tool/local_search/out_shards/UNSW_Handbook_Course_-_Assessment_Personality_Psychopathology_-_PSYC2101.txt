Description
Systematic measurement of various aspects of people occurs in many different settings such as clinical, counselling, legal, educational and vocational guidance, and personnel settings. The principles and techniques of psychological measurement, will be discussed, including consideration of what makes tests useful, how to evaluate tests and factors that are important to consider in their interpretation. Underlying many tests are theoretical positions about personality and/or about what is 'normal' and 'abnormal' behaviour. Discussion of how aspects of personality are operationalised and measured will enable students to understand how tests relate to these theories. Importantly, theories and research relating to psychopathology will also be included and the basics of clinical assessment will be discussed. The practical program will provide the opportunity to explore the application of tests in a number of different settings.
