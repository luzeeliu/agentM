Description
Social innovation, the outcome of the work of social entrepreneurs and others can be developed in almost any context. It is often a response to an identified problem, issue or opportunity. Design thinking and methods take a whole systems, rather than a silo, approach to offer different perspectives to the traditional business tools.
Design for Social Innovation offers participants the opportunity to learn and apply design tools and methods to real projects with a focus on social outcomes.
This course is an elective subject for the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact, and an elective available for all postgraduate students. It provides an overview and introduction to the role and application of design concepts in social innovation and social enterprise.
The course will provide the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and apply design principles at a project or organisational level.
This course is an Elective in the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact program (7357) and the Business Administration (Specialised) – 8625: Social Impact - MNGTKS8625 Stream.
