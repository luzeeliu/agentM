The major in Advanced Statistics has been designed to ensure that graduates are well trained in three key areas: probability and stochastic processes, statistical inference and modelling, and modern statistical computing methods. Third year electives allow students to further develop their statistical capabilities according to their own interests. Computing has become firmly entrenched in modern Statistics and our courses take full advantage of our excellent computing facilities. This will only enhance the portfolio of skills that students bring to their career.
