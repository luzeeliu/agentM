In the modern global economy, the economic forces and policies of every country affect and are affected by those of the rest of the world. This course introduces you to the key concepts of open-economy macroeconomics and develops a framework in which to analyze issues of importance to an economy that interacts with the world. This framework is applied to aid in understanding international macroeconomic issues such as international asset flows, determination of exchange rates, the current account balance, fiscal and monetary policy in an open economy, policies under various exchange rate regimes, monetary unions, and international economic crises. You will gain experience interpreting, analyzing, and putting into perspective real international economic issues.
