You have already learnt the basics (such as numbers, how to say your name, age, etc.) but don't feel confident enough in using the French language in usual everyday situations? Then this course will be perfect for you as it will help you consolidate previous knowledge and develop new competencies in both spoken and written French, whether in personal or professional circumstances. Going shopping, ordering food, talking about your past experiences or making plans for the future are just examples of real life situations that this course will enable you to successfully navigate. Come and join us if you really want to make the most of all those intercultural experiences awaiting you!
Please note, students who have not successfully completed ARTS1480 but who have had previous experience with the French language (either as a heritage language or previous instruction) must complete the placement questionnaire available at
https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements
. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
