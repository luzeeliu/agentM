This course affords students the opportunity to develop knowledge and understanding of international aspect of information systems/technology (IS/IT) business operations (e.g. AI, block chain, IoT, business analytics, e-commerce etc,) through the firsthand observation of businesses in Asian-Pacific countries such as China, India, Hong Kong, and South Korea. The central components of the course include a two-week study tour to one Asian country, in which a number of leading international and national companies, including companies operating in the IS/IT sector and those in other sectors with a significant IS/IT footprint, will be visited in order to enable students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which IS/IT transformed business operations and business systems differ across national boundaries. After returning to the campus, students are required to submit a written report on a topic of interest and based on their observations of the businesses and the country. A group presentation and personal reflection report are to be delivered prior to the end of the Term.
This course is offered to a maximum number of 25 students currently enrolled in UNSW Business School. Eligible students wishing to complete this course will be required to submit an online Expression of Interest by the advertised date. Please enquire with the School for further information.
