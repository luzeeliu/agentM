Description
Models for routing of flows along channels and rivers will be presented including model theory, selection, calibration, validation and reliability; models will include Muskingham, kinematic wave, non-inertial and diffusion and dynamic wave; sediment and pollutant transport water quality methods and models will also be presented including plug-flow and advection-dispersion in both coupled and uncoupled applications; estuarine classification and density structure; tides, water level response, mixing processes and flushing of estuaries; estuarine difference models including hydrodynamic stratification and algal dynamics; random walk and box models; biochemical processes in estuaries.
