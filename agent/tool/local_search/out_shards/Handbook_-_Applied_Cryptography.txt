Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. This course is designed to provide an understanding of Cryptographic algorithms and Cryptanalysis with an aim of using them to protect computer systems, networks, and data protection. The course will emphasise on the foundational aspects of encryption and authentication techniques with an aim to use them correctly and effectively in applications.
The technical ideas to be understood include classical algorithms, symmetric key encryption algorithms, public key encryption algorithms, cryptanalysis of ciphers, hash functions, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs. Applications like credential management, computing on encrypted data in cloud (homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation), secure network protocols, blockchains will be explored. Post quantum Cryptography will also be studied.
