A major research project is the culmination of the undergraduate Bachelor of City Planning (Hons) program. The form of the project is most conventionally a written thesis. The option of incorporating a significant multi-media (e.g. CD-ROM) component may be approved. The thesis project is an individual study taken with the object of allowing students to acquire more specialised knowledge. The range of topics and the methodology is flexible, but a rigorous approach is required. A thesis proposal was developed in the complementary course PLAN4001. While most research, analysis and final preparation may be done off-campus, students are required to maintain close contact with their supervisors throughout the Term 3. There is a minimum requirement of five meetings with individual supervisors in Term 3. In addition to supervisory meetings, students are required to attend course meetings with the convenor and the entire class; the dates for these meetings will be established prior to T3 commencement.
