Expand all
Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
Applicants require a recognised undergraduate degree (or equivalent qualification) with a credit average, as determined by the UNSW Business School.

GMAT score is at least 600 for the GMAT Exam or at least 565 for the GMAT Focus Edition. The Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is an exam created to measure the academic abilities needed to succeed in graduate management education. Further information can be obtained from

Professional qualifications completed through relevant professional bodies, for example the Institute of Chartered Accountants or CPA Australia
Relevant work experience is not a requirement but may be taken into consideration as an indicator of performance to support the application
