The Master of Architecture / Master of Property and Development double degree will allow you to complete two complementary programs in an accelerated timeframe. By completing this double degree you will develop your creative architectural design skills, while simultaneously advancing your commercial knowledge and understanding of real estate, property investment and law.
Completing both degrees will provide you with a competitive advantage in industry, with broader careers options across both architectural practice and property development and the ability to lead multi-disciplinary project teams.
In this double degree, you will take 96 units of credit (UoC) for the Master of Architecture and 72UoC for the Master of Property and Development for a total of 168UoC. Because the elective courses in both degrees are equivalent, the total units of credit required for completion is reduced by 24UoC to 144UoC. Up to 24UoC in elective course credit can be counted towards the requirements of both programs. (Please see Academic Rules below for more details).
