The Bachelor of Architectural Studies at UNSW is focused on the evolving and interrelated challenges of architecture, urbanism, and environmental sustainability. The program structure, with studio-based learning at its core, allows you to explore architectural design through hands-on projects and interdisciplinary learning activities.
From day one, courses will introduce you to real-world design challenges and issues such as climate-responsive architecture, housing, and cultural safety. Our curriculum seamlessly integrates environmental sustainability, construction principles, and digital design to equip you with the skills to create adaptive and resilient built environments.
A strength of the program is its focus on architecture in practice. You will engage with industry professionals and real-world projects and develop the ability to navigate design processes, construction methods, and professional legal and social responsibilities. You will explore First Nations knowledge and perspectives, ensuring that your work respects cultural heritage and fosters inclusive communities. Studio projects will expose you to the complexities of contemporary practice, preparing you to work effectively in teams and respond to environmental and social considerations.
Upon completing this degree, you will be equipped for diverse career pathways in architecture and related design-based industries or you may continue your studies in the accredited UNSW Master of Architecture program, which is a pathway to professional registration.
