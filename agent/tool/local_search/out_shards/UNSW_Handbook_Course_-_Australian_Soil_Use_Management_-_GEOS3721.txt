Description
Students will study, interpret and explore the interrelationships between the various soil-forming factors and processes, the physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of soil and how soil is used and managed in Australia. The course introduces students to modern methods and applications of remotely-sensed geophysical data and GIS techniques to model and map the spatial distribution of soil properties. Laboratory work involves the synthesis of the theoretical components of soil usage and management using field (real world) data collected from northern New South Wales.
