Award(s):
Bachelor of Science (Major)
Stream Outline
Bioinformatics is becoming a central enabling discipline in the life sciences with the explosion in high-throughput data generated by genomics and proteomics technologies. Bioinformatics applies the methods and discipline of computer science and statistics to the data and goals of molecular biology and provides a computational framework to analyse these data and generate new knowledge in the life sciences.
The day to day administration of this part of the program is conducted through the Computer Science and Engineering Student Office.
This page outlines the core program rules for the Bioinformatics stream when taken as part of a single or dual award in Science, Science (International), Science and Business, and Advanced Science.   Advice regarding the order and placement of courses in the program can be found on the
CSE website

Notes:
To continue in this major students are required to get a credit or higher in MATH1031 Mathematics for Life Sciences. Where students do not meet this requirement they will need to consider undertaking a different major within their Science program. Advice on related majors can be received from staff in the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science.
Students considering transferring to the 3707 Bachelor of Engineering in Bioinformatics Engineering, should enrol in MATH1131 (or MATH1141) and MATH1231 (or MATH1241) otherwise they will be ineligible for full credit on transfer to the Engineering program.
Honours
For further information on Honours in Bioinformatics, please see staff in either the School of Computer Science and Engineering (for research focused more primarily on the computational side of Bioinformatics), or the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science (for research focused more primarily on the biology aspect of Bioinformatics).
