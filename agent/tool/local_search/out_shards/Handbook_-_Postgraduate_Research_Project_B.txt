Research is the agent for generating new knowledge about our world, creating the basis for new innovations, and transforming professional practice. Today, research in the School of Chemical Engineering is transforming how we feed the world, treat disease, produce resources and consumer products and power our economy. In Postgraduate Research Project B you will continue to engage with this research and/or industrial research and development.
This is the second course of the two course Postgraduate Research Project sequence. In these inquiry-based learning courses, you will integrate your discipline knowledge and skills learned through academic study and professional experience at an advanced level. You will apply your specialised cognitive and technical skills to innovatively solve problems and/or generate knowledge in chemical engineering, food science and related disciplines.
The project you undertake will address a complex, open-ended problem that allows room for the creative, critical and reflective acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. At the outset there will be multiple possible solutions or interpretations, and the problem will be sufficiently complex that you will need to carefully design and manage the project to reach a successful conclusion.
In this course, you will continue to be assisted in this process by a supervisor, as you complete the project work you started in Postgraduate Research Project A and communicate your findings in written and oral forms.
