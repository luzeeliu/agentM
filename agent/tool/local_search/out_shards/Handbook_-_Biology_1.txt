Biology is the study of life and living organisms.The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences offers expertise in the fields of botany, ecology, marine biology and zoology. Botany explores aspects of both green and non-green plants and their relation to the environment. An understanding of ecology is necessary for conservation. Marine biology is about life in the ocean, estuaries and other coastal environments. Zoology looks at the structure, behaviour, habits, genetics, distribution, evolution and classification of animals.
