Description
The first half of this course introduces the morphological and molecular mechanisms of segmentation and patterning responsible for organising the body plan in the embryo. Topics will include the molecular, genetic and cellular approaches to the study of human embryology using four main vertebrate systems: frog, fish, chick and mouse. The second half of this course will cover human fetal development through to birth, including the developmental anatomy of the organ systems. The course will examine the common principles and differences that underlie normal and abnormal development of vertebrates: specifically, the roles of cell differentiation, proliferation and migration, target recognition, interaction in the nervous system, axial polarity, cell adhesion, cell fate and signalling. Emerging technologies such as genomic analysis and the use of transgenic and dysfunctional mouse mutants in research will be covered.
