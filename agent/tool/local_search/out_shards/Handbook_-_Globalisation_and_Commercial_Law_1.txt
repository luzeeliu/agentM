What role does commercial regulation and governance play in shaping the opportunities and challenges of globalisation? This course dives into the evolving relationship between globalisation and commercial law, uncovering how international trade, investment, finance and multi-national corporate power are governed—or left unchecked—on the global stage. You will explore key legal challenges including how regulatory gaps, trade wars, economic crises, and international and investor-State disputes are managed by the key stakeholders - nations, international organisations, multinational corporations - while critically examining the impact on national sovereignty and the (in)equality of nation states. Through real-world examples and thought-provoking discussions, this course invites you to think beyond borders, question existing frameworks, and imagine innovative legal solutions for a more equitable global future.
Main Topics:
The Evolution of Globalisation and Its Impact on Commercial Regulation and Governance
International Trade Frameworks
Cross-Border Investment and Multinational Corporations
International Financial Systems
Governance of Intellectual Property
Nation State and Investor-State Dispute Resolution
Global Economic Crises and Legal Responses
