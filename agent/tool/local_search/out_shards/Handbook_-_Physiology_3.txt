Physiology is all about what makes human bodies work - how we sustain health and function in the face of different living conditions. Physiology integrates function right from molecules and cells of the body, through to organs and how the different organ systems work together. A physiologist develops an understanding of the functions of each of the different organ systems of the body – the brain, muscles, cardio-respiratory systems and others – and how these all work together to sustain the life of an organism. Physiology underpins many other aspects of biology, health sciences and Medicine, and is a prelude to study of disease processes and their treatments. The discipline strongly complements the allied disciplines of neuroscience, anatomy, pharmacology and pathology.
