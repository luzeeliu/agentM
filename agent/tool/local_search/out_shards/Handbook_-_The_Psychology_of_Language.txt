The psychology of language, or psycholinguistics, is the scientific study of the relationship between language and psychology. The more you understand about the psychology of language, how it is acquired, and how it is processed, the more you understand about yourself and the people and world around you. In this course, you will learn how we acquire, develop, and use language in general and specialised contexts. By developing an understanding of contemporary research methods, including language performance tasks, eye tracking and brain imaging, you will identify the relationship between language, cognition, and behaviour. You will evaluate the application of various fundamental approaches in psycholinguistics to identify how they account for the psychological processes underlying the production, processing and representation of human language. You will also explore atypical language development, language impairment, and clinical contexts.
