Progression Opportunities
Upon successfully completing four courses, students have two choices:
- Graduate directly from the Graduate Certificate.
- Apply for articulation to the 5546 Graduate Diploma in Information Technology or 8543 Master of Information Technology before graduation, receiving credit for the courses already completed.
Guidance for Course Selection
It is crucial for students to carefully consider their choices when selecting courses for the Graduate Certificate. This is especially important if they plan to articulate into the Graduate Diploma or pursue the Master of Information Technology (MIT), ensuring that their selected courses align with the requirements of their preferred specialisation.
