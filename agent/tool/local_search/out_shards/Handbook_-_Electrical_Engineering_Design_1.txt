Design is one of the critical foundations of engineering, requiring complex technical skills, creativity, project management, teamwork, as well as knowledge of professional ethical standards in design.
This design course caters for electrical engineering students. Students are required to design and build an electrical engineering project. This process will include producing specifications, detailed design, prototype production, and testing. The design will be pitched in a presentation that includes a needs assessment, requirements analysis, proposed design, business case and development plans. The design of the final prototype and working of the functional prototype will be demonstrated in a presentation while a formal technical report will be produced to document the final design details, product specifications, performance assessment and safety/sustainability considerations. A final examination will delve into the intellectual property landscape, product sustainability issues and standards applicable in electrical engineering design.
The course contents include
Design methodologies (systematic design procedures, documentation, reporting),
Design project management (scheduling, costing, marketing, patents, electronic manufacturing methods),
Designing for quality, innovation, manufacture, maintenance, minimum life cycle cost, sustainability, standards and safety compliance, and
Aspects of electronic design (component selection, tolerances, passive component characteristics, EMC, earthing, PCB layout principles, CAD tools).
