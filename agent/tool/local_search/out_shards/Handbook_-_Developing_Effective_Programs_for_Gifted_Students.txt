This course focuses on current research on the components of appropriate program development for gifted and talented students. Program models currently used in Australia and internationally will be critically evaluated. You will be required to conduct needs analyses, develop program goals and design programs appropriate for gifted students within the administrative structures and education systems of their state or country. Research on the effectiveness of enrichment, acceleration and various forms of ability, achievement and interest grouping will be closely examined, with particular attention to the effects of these strategies on the students' academic and social development. The need for counselling and mentoring to be included in programs for gifted students and programs designed to include minority, twice-exceptional and underachieving students will also be a focus.
