Biotechnology innovation is driven by the requirement for improvements in medical diagnosis and therapy for a range of diseases including autoimmune, inflammation, cancer, and infectious diseases. Innovations in biomolecular therapies such as recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, stem cells and novel bioinspired materials have and will continue to improve available medical treatments for many conditions. The lectures will give students a detailed insight into the principles and techniques leading to these innovations. The wet lab practical is designed to give students experience of the pre-clinical development of novel antibody-based therapeutics. Workshops will be conducted to enhance students’ scientific writing and oral presentation skills. Feedback sessions will provide students with feedback on their assessment tasks.
