Microbes have been living on this planet for billions of years longer than we have, and they have evolved in all sorts of interesting and useful ways! As engineers, we need to understand how microbes affect natural and constructed systems, how we can use these organisms to improve our engineered processes and how we can mitigate the risks associated with harmful microbes.
CVEN9886 will equip you with the basic knowledge and the tools – critical analysis, teamwork and communication skills – to work on real-world assignments and to be able to collaborate with experts and microbiologists in multidisciplinary projects. You will be equipped to tackle crucial global challenges, including:
- How can we improve water quality and sanitation around the world?
- Can we slow down climate change using microbes?
- How can we leverage microbial processes to protect vulnerable communities and ecosystems?
