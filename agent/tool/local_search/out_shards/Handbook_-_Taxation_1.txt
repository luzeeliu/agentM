Taxation funds the provision of government services, is a tool in economic management and is an important consideration in all business decisions. Indeed, in a modern business environment no decision can be responsibly made without consideration being given to tax implications.
Taxation affects every aspect of commercial life from the choice of business vehicle to the financing of business operations, to the offshore expansion of a business, to the retirement plans for employees.
