COMP6080 aims to develop your confidence in building modern web-based applications to industry standards. This occurs through the introduction of a range of basic concepts surrounding HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Javascript Declarative Frameworks, UI/UX Principles, Accessibility, Network & Asynchronous Programming, Front-end Testing, and other basic infrastructure.
This course has a heavy emphasis on industry voices, and as such a number of lectures will be given by current front-end developers from industry. These lectures primarily come from employees at Canva, a Sydney-based technology company that does a lot of work with front-end technologies.
COMP6080 is a challenging course. Front-end development is unlike most things you've experienced at university before. You will find the individual problems you solve much simpler than other level 6 courses, but the time you will feel that you spend on the aggregate of these issues will feel larger. A number of students will find this course quite time consuming if they're hoping to achieve a high mark. We'd encourage you to reflect on this fact before you enrol in the course.
