This course is the first of two courses that provide you with the knowledge of various physical principles and manufacturing technologies that are typically encountered by industrial designers in the development of products. In this course, you will be introduced to the physical properties of materials and their related manufacturing principles, structure, mechanical devices, and electronic componentry. You will develop a technical and analytical approach to product development through written assessments and demonstrate your understanding and creative application of this knowledge through practical projects. These skills will enable you to conceive innovative product design solutions that are informed by realistic expectations of product function, performance, and use. Furthermore, the course will equip you with the foundational communication skills required to discuss your design proposals with technical experts, such as manufacturing engineers and materials specialists.
