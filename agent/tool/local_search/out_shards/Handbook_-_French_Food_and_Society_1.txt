One of the most enduring ideas associated with France is that it is the country of food and wine. The tradition of French gastronomy, recognized in 2010 by the inclusion of the French gastronomic meal and its rituals in the list of intangible UNESCO cultural heritage, is an integral part of French identity. The behaviours and values associated with food and wine are an essential component of successful social and business interactions in France and Francophone countries. They therefore constitute a rich entry into French culture that may facilitate future professional interactions and cultural sensitivity. Through the analysis of films and documentaries, and various genres of literary and culinary texts (blogs, dictionaries, essays, and guides), this course will allow you to discover the evolution of French society through its rich culinary tradition. You will explore varied practices in the Francophone world and meet industry professionals who will explain how they navigate the challenges of globalisation, sustainability, or foreign influence.
All assessment to be completed in French if you have selected to take this course as a professional elective.
