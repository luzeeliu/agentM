This course complements PSYC4103 Psychology 4B as part of the compulsory coursework requirement of the Honours Program in Psychology. PSYC4093 is split into a core component and an elective component.
The core component is taken by all students and comprises a weekly 2-hour lecture (Weeks 1-10) and 1 hour tutorial (Weeks 1-10). The core component covers (i) ethical issues for psychologists, and (ii) history and systems of psychology. The ethics section of the course deals with the principles of ethical conduct by psychologists and places emphasis on ethical issues in professional practice. It provides students with an understanding and familiarity with the regulatory and legislative framework pertaining to the practice of professional psychology. Some attention will be given to ethical issues in research. The history and systems section of the course provides ahistorical introduction to some of the enduring conceptual issues in psychology. Its aim is to clarify contemporary treatments of these issues by considering their past.
The elective component is delivered in a seminar mode with students split into smaller groups. Each elective stream engages students with a contemporary research topic and consists of a weekly 2-hour seminar in Weeks 1-10.
