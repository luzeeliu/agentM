In this course you will be introduced to criminological thinking and practice in the context of climate change and the environment. It provides a critical and theoretical understanding of the criminal justice system and its interaction with the environment, including drivers and contexts of environmental and climate crimes, impacts on different human and non-human victims (e.g. ecosystems and animals) at local and global levels and the challenges of balancing environmental, social and economic justice. The course examines four mediating relationships between criminology, the environment and climate change that cover interactions between temporal and geographic scales, the economy, non-human victims and human rights and culture.
