This course provides an introduction to safety risk management including models of incident causation, the risk management framework, and concepts of injury management and hazard control. Models for managing workplace safety are introduced as these underlie the management systems for many other risks.
Students will be asked to apply risk management techniques to a range of hazards and hazardous scenarios, evaluate issues in their measurement, monitoring and risk management, and will have the opportunity to share and discuss their own experiences of managing risks. Key issues in human performance affecting the practice of modern risk management will also be considered.
Students will evaluate conceptual issues surrounding a range of hazards where human interaction with systems is paramount, and consider their measurement, monitoring, and risk management strategies. Commonly employed hazard control mechanisms, which are relevant to human performance will also be evaluated. Students will be asked to apply risk management techniques to these hazards, and will have the opportunity to share and discuss their own experiences of managing risks.
