Overview
The course starts with an introduction to the atmosphere, especially the troposphere and lower stratosphere where aircraft spend most of their time. We discuss the difference between true and equivalent airspeeds. Then we introduce the basic equations that describe straight & level flight.

The course starts with an introduction to the atmosphere, especially the troposphere and lower stratosphere where aircraft spend most of their time. We discuss the difference between true and equivalent airspeeds. Then we introduce the basic equations that describe straight & level flight.
You are introduced to the propeller as a means of propulsion. Propellers are often driven by reciprocating piston engines and so we discuss their behavior as well as the basics of chemical reactions and the behavior of gas mixtures.
Then we get back to flight mechanics introducing the basic equations that describe of climbing, gliding, and turning flight.
We introduce the fundamental equations associated with compressible flows, normal shocks, oblique shocks prior to looking at gas turbine engines.
Then we discuss the basic operation of helicopters and quad rotor drones. We give a very basic introduction to electric motors.
Finally, we return to flight mechanics again introducing the Breguet range equations, take-off, landing, and energy methods.
