3563 Economics / Science - Special arrangements for Mathematics and Economics Courses
keyboard_arrow_down
Bachelor of Science students should note that they are, in most, instances required to complete two Level 1 MATH courses to meet the requirements for the BEc core quantitative courses ECON1202 and ECON1203.
Students should do the MATH courses which are required in the Bachelor of Science specialisations they choose. In a few of the BSc specialisations only one MATH course is required, in which case students should complete an appropriate second MATH course or its equivalent ECON course (ECON1202 or ECON1203).
Specifically:
- Any one of the following courses is an acceptable substitute for ECON1202: MATH1031 or MATH1131 or MATH1141 or MATH1151.
- Any one of the following courses is an acceptable substitute for ECON1203: MATH1041 or MATH2089 or MATH2099 or MATH2801 or MATH2841 or MATH2901 or ACTL2002 or ACTL2131.
- ECON1203 may be substituted by PSYC2001 for those students who also do a major in Psychology.

Additional Information
Further Double Degree Specific Rules con't - If you complete the sequence MATH1131/MATH1231 or MATH1141/MATH1241 or MATH1151/MATH1251 you may use this as a substitute for the sequence ECON1202/ECON1203. These substitutes for the compulsory core courses count towards the 16 Business School courses (96 UOC) required for the degree.
Please Note: ECON1202 and ECON1203 may not be good substitutes for the indicated MATH and ACTL courses depending on your program. You should check with your program authority regarding course substitutions.
Students have the option of counting the MATH courses towards the BSc and doing additional electives offered by the School of Economics OR counting the MATH courses towards the BEc and doing additional electives offered by UNSW Science.
