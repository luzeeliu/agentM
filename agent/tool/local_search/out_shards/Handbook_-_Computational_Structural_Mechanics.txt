You will study modern numerical methods and their applications to structures and other civil engineering problems by the use of commercial finite element software. The acquired knowledge is applicable to the analysis and design of many types of civil engineering constructions such as buildings, foundations, dams, etc. You are expected to be familiar with the theories and concepts introduced in the previous structural engineering courses.
This course lays the foundation for in-depth study of numerical simulation, which is a rapidly evolving and multi-disciplinary field. The material covered in this course is essential in modern structural analysis and design. Topics covered include: Introduction to finite elements using seepage analysis. Basis of finite elements: elasticity, variational theorems, constraint equations. Beam elements and frame analysis. Stress analysis using linear elements. Finite element modelling considerations. Isoparametric elements.
