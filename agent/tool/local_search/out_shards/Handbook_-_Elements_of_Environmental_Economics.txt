This course provides an introduction to markets and market failure in the context of the environment. You will learn the reasons behind why environmental problems exist, and economic solutions to these problems, which include regulations, taxes, subsidies, and pollution permit trading schemes. Methods for determining the benefits and costs of environmental preservation are covered. While controversial at times, such accounting is fundamental to social decision making. One goal of the course is to make you aware that the answer to environmental issues is not as simple as "save the planet", and that there are other perspectives, complexities and trade-offs that must be taken into account. This course helps in providing you with a basic understanding of environmental issues and policies, grounded in economic principles.
In this course, you will develop a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of environmental economics. You will gain knowledge in key areas such as non-market valuation, natural resource management, market failure, and the design of incentives to encourage pro-environmental behavior. Additionally, you will build a strong foundation in microeconomic theory, both in general and specifically in relation to environmental issues.
