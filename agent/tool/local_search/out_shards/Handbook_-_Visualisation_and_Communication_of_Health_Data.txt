Health Data Scientists need to present information to audiences across a range of backgrounds and spanning a spectrum from non-practitioners of a discipline to highly informed and expert audiences. Effective communication across different media types is essential. Appropriate data visualisation techniques can greatly enhance communication and increase the effectiveness of communication. Increasingly the scientific community has become aware of problems regarding lack of transparency and reproducibility.
This course takes a toolbox approach to creating appropriate, reproducible, and transparent analyses and visualisations. The R software ecosystems is used primarily but the course also covers the use of Python and other software platforms for visualisation and communication. The course presents useful best-practice data science analysis and visualisation techniques with a focus on different types of data visualisations.
Theory aspects of the course cover basic understanding of how people process information, and effective communication of technical and quantitative information to different types of audience, including people with perceptual disabilities.
