Description
The stars form the basic building blocks of our Galaxy, and make up one of the fundamental scales on which structure is found in the Universe. This course provides an introduction to the physics of stars, galaxies and the universe. The aim is to give students an introduction to our state of knowledge about these fundamental astronomical objects, what they contain, their physical parameters, how they function and how they evolve. The basic mathematical formalism governing the physics of is presented, though the detailed solution of the equations is not attempted. Topics to be covered include: Galaxies, their composition. The distance scale. Large-scale structure of the universe. Galaxy evolution. Stellar radiation, spectra classification. Hertzsprung Russell diagrams, determination of stellar masses and radii. Equations of stellar structure. Energy sources in star: nuclear reaction cycles, energy transport, equations of state, degeneracy, opacity. Properties of main sequence stars: stellar evolution, structure of red giants and white dwarfs. The solar atmosphere.
