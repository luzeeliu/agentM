This course aims to explore in depth the practice of developing database applications and the theory behind relational database systems. It will also give a very brief overview of the technologies used in implementing database management systems and the past, present and future of database systems.
Large data resources are critical to the functioning of just about every significant modern computer application. Hence, knowledge of how to manage them is clearly important to the IT industry. In the context of further study, COMP3311 also provides a foundation for further study in advanced database topics, such as
COMP9312
Graph Data Analytics, and
COMP9315
Database Systems Implementation. Database concepts are also relevant in courses such as
COMP9319
Web Data Compression and Search and
COMP6714
Information Retrieval and Web Search.
By the end of this course, we want you to be capable of building high-quality (correct and efficient) applications based on relational databases, to have a sound understanding of issues in managing relational database management systems, and an overview of how they work internally.
