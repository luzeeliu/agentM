Overview
Distributed energy generation is developing into a significant market in the generation, distribution and utilisation of electrical energy. It includes local fossil fuel-derived energy sources, for example, co-generation from liquefied natural gas, renewable energy sources, such as wind and hydro, and low-carbon hybrid energy systems that combine energy sources from… For more content click the Read More button below.
Distributed energy generation is developing into a significant market in the generation, distribution and utilisation of electrical energy. It includes local fossil fuel-derived energy sources, for example, co-generation from liquefied natural gas, renewable energy sources, such as wind and hydro, and low-carbon hybrid energy systems that combine energy sources from more than one energy source, whether renewable or fossil-fuelled. This course will equip you with the fundamental technical and economic processes and drivers at play in the electrical power industry.
Issues that will be covered include the basics of distribution network modelling, the different types of distributed energy sources utilised (combined heat and power, wind, hydro, photovoltaics, energy storage) and how they are integrated onto the electrical grid, the impact of the integration of such sources on the fundamental operation of the distribution and transmission networks, and how distributed generation is impacting on the development and operation of market frameworks.
