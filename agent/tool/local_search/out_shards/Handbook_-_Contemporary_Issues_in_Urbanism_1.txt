This elective course is designed as a vehicle for the exploration of current interdisciplinary issues in urban theory and practice. In 2014, the course will focus on the emerging practice known as DIY urbanism, which involves the creation of small-scale, informal interventions in public space. Over recent years, DIY urbanism has gained significant media and academic attention around the world as a new grassroots approach to urban design and engagement. This course will encourage students to embrace the current enthusiasm for DIY urbanism, while also requiring them to look beyond the 'trendy' façade and to critically examine the theoretical, aesthetic and practical issues DIY urbanism poses for both city residents and urban professionals. It will draw on materials from a range of disciplinary perspectives including urban planning, urban design, architectural theory, sociology and media theory.
