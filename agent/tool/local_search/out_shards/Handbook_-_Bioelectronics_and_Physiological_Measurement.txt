The human body is a fascinating network of electrical impulses, enabling us to perform everyday functions such as seeing, hearing, and reacting to stimuli. Understanding these electrical currents is crucial, as any disruption can lead to health issues. This course introduces you to the world of bioelectronics and physiological measurement, focusing on the essential knowledge required for bio-electrodes, the interfaces used to measure or control electrical signals within the human body.
The course covers the basics of electric circuit theory and the biological mechanisms underlying electrical signals. It also includes a practical component with laboratory exercises that introduce you to the field of bioelectronics, basic programming, and bio-signal analytics and classification.
By the end of this course, you will have a foundational understanding of how to use various instruments, such as oscilloscopes and signal generators, for biomedical electronics. You will also gain skills in using software tools like LabChart, PowerLab, and Matlab for programming, bio-signal acquisition, bio-signal/data analysis, and modelling techniques in simulating biological systems.
Moreover, you will develop an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for bioelectric signals that are measured or elicited in medical and clinical settings. This course serves as a stepping stone for those interested in further studies or a career in bioelectronics and physiological measurement. It provides a solid foundation for understanding the complex electrical systems within the human body and how they can be measured and analysed for health and medical purposes.
