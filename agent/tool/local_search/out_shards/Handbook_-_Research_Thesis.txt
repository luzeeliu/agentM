This course permits an individual student to undertake a research project on a legal topic of their choice. The project must have a clearly defined topic which has been approved by the academic supervisor of the project. Students should approach potential supervisors to discuss a) their availability to supervise the project and b) the suitability and formulation of the topic.
This is a supervised research exercise. Subject to the requirements of individual supervisors, students are expected to provide supervisors with at least a full plan for their project and one draft during the session prior to submission. Supervisors and students should negotiate at the beginning when they will meet, when work will be handed in, and what kind of feedback will be given.
For enrolment in a 6 UOC Research Thesis the following requirements must be met:
A member of staff has agreed to supervise the project.
The project is clearly defined and is approved by the supervisor.
The student has a sufficient academic background in legal study to enable the thesis to be completed in a satisfactory manner (as a general rule a weighted average mark of at least 65% (Credit) in previous law courses is required.)
Students who have recorded an academic failure in the year prior may have their application refused.
Students who have recorded an academic failure in a research intensive course at any point in the past may have their application refused.
A permanent or sessional member of academic staff may be the primary supervisor, but in the latter case a permanent member of staff must also be recorded on the enrolment. Generally this will be the sessional staff member’s Faculty contact person.
