This is a hybrid course. It is available to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The course content, delivery and assessment will be identical for both groups of students.
Professional experience is the central component of all pre-service teacher education programs. Professional Experience 2/Internship is the final capstone course in the pre-service teaching program, done concurrently with or after all other core courses. All pre=service teachers complete 8 weeks of university based classes before a 9-week (45 day) professional experience block in a NSW school. The placement begins with 3 days of structured observation followed by 22 days of closely supervised teaching, followed by 20 days of more independent teaching, taking one half of a teacher’s normal load. Professional Experience 2/Internship allows pre-service teachers to achieve the AITSL standards for a graduate teacher. It aims to develop a strong commitment, enthusiasm and respect for the teaching professions and encourages pre-service teachers to engage with the broader community.
Note:
Professional Experience 2/Internship occurs at the times specified by the School of Education. In order to arrange timely professional experience placements, pre-service teachers must log in to the School of Education’s online placement system and enter requested information no later than week 2 of the term they will be completing their Professional Experience 2.
