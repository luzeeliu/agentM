This is a second year mathematics course for engineering students which introduces fundamental mathematical concepts that are used in many areas of physics and engineering.
This course includes two streams, vector calculus and complex analysis. The vector calculus stream studies calculus for functions involving multiple variables. Topics covered in this stream include curves in space; optimization methods for functions of two and three variables; double and triple integration; line and surface integrals, and the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. The complex analysis stream studies differentiation and integration for functions of a complex variable. Topics in this stream include mapping problems; the Cauchy-Riemann equations; the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem and Cauchy’s Integral formula; Taylor and Laurent series; and applications of complex function theory to real integration.
The course delivery includes lectures and tutorials.
Note: This course is available only to students for whom it is specifically required as part of their program.
