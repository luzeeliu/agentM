Psychology is concerned with the scientific study of behaviour and its underlying mental and neural processes. Criminology is concerned with broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, policing, state crime, alternative justice systems, criminalisation and regulation. Taken together, students completing the B Psychological Science / B Criminology and Criminal Justice dual will be equipped with an interdisciplinary knowledge base and skill set that will open a myriad of career pathways and opportunities.
Psychology is a discipline of both scientific research and applied practice. Students in the Bachelor of Psychological Science program gain an integrated and comprehensive education in main discipline areas, including developmental, social, cognitive, biological, physiological and abnormal psychology. The program also develops research methods and data analysis skills. Psychology has many areas of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and students have an option to pursue individual interests, choosing electives from a range of specialist areas, including psychology and law; psychology and work; development disorders; psychopathology; health psychology, language, cognitive science, neuroscience and others.
Psychology has many areas of application, especially in clinical, correctional, counselling, educational, and organisational settings. In addition, people with training in psychology pursue careers in academic research, health research, developmental disabilities and rehabilitation, ergonomics, occupational health and safety, personnel selection, training, and management, vocational guidance, and marketing.
The program allows students to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate sequence in psychology. Upon completion of this program students may choose to complete an additional fourth year program in psychology (Honours), subject to satisfying the entry requirements.
The Bachelor of Criminology & Criminal Justice (BCCJ) is an innovative and interdisciplinary field of study with a real-world focus designed to give students the opportunity to explore interests in crime, deviance, social control and the legal system. Key concerns include the nature of crime, how crime is defined and measured, why people commit crime and how societies might respond. Within the BCCJ program, students have the opportunity to tackle present day social problems including victimisation, juvenile justice, drug-related harm, community safety, Indigenous justice, environmental harm and state crime. Criminology is shaped by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, and other interdisciplinary fields including history, politics, economics, architecture, and cultural studies. The UNSW BCCJ also provides students with in-depth training in the applied social research and policy skills required to translate this knowledge into practice.
The Bachelor of Psychological Science / Bachelor of Criminology & Criminal Justice is a 4-year program (full-time). The Psychological Science program allows students to complete an accredited Psychology degree with the option to apply for an additional Honours Year in Psychology through 4518 Psychological Science (Honours).
