This course examines interethnic and interfaith relations in Europe in the last two centuries. You will learn about the historical sources of the ethnic and cultural diversities in modern and contemporary Europe. You will discuss selected case studies from the two centuries after the birth of liberalism and tolerance at the end of the 18th century and after the rise of ethnic nationalism in the 19th century. You will analyse the mutual ideological, social and cultural perceptions and constructions of ‘otherness’ between the minorities and the majority societies. You will acquire in-depth knowledge of key issues, developments and examples from the French revolution through to the present, such as the Emancipation of the Jews in the 19th century, the Pale of Settlement, anti-Semitism, Armenian genocide, Communist ideology, Romani minorities, and Muslim minorities in contemporary Europe.
