The Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (Honours) is designed for talented students with exceptional analytic skills and a thirst for the knowledge and expertise that will help them build the technologies of the future. The Core courses provide a solid grounding in the fundamentals of programming, software engineering, computer hardware, data structures and algorithms. Computing electives provide technical skills and a broad knowledge of the field, while advanced computing electives and Honours thesis allow for an in-depth understanding in a specially chosen area. Free electives can be used to pursue other topics of interest. This degree provides excellent preparation for postgraduate study, for joining or building a technologically innovative organisation, or making a substantive contribution to information technology in any field of endeavour.
This is the default Major for students in the 3779 Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science program.
