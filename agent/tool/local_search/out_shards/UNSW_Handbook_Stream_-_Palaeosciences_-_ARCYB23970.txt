Stream Outline
The Palaeosciences minor places emphasis on the courses convened by members of the Palaeontology, Geobiology and Earth Archives (PANGEA) Research Centre in the School of BEES. The Minor particularly considers the inter-connections between the evolution of the Earth’s physical, climatic and biotic systems. This minor also provides you with the tools and knowledge to explore two unifying themes - evolution (physical and cultural) and the interaction between humans and their natural environment using long temporal perspectives.
