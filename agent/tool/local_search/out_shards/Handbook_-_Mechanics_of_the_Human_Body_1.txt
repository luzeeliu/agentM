Described by many students as one of the most engaging courses taken during their engineering studies, BIOM9541 has evolved over time based on student feedback to include more hands-on experiments and less theoretical assessments. Our priority access to Neuroscience Research Australia's (NeuRA) state-of-the-art 3D motion capture facilities is used to teach current advances in human movement science. Mechanics of the Human Body combines the state-of-the-art with newly emerging opensource markerless technologies to enhance future wide spread clinical, industry and remote applications of the course content - both within the laboratory and outside of the laboratory setting.
Have you ever wondered how athletes can use advanced tools to analyse their movements to improve performance? How Lord of the Rings or Avatar were created? Or how advances in wearable technology, phone apps and smart garments can be used to detect, analyse and predict injuries and health outcomes? And even be used to help people with Parkinson's disease walk with confidence? This course introduces students to the methods used in the analysis of human movement in sports, medicine, health and entertainment. It including applications in sport biomechanics and musculoskeletal modelling. Methods and software are introduced to analyse body segment and joint kinematics, joint kinetics, work and power, muscle forces and associated energy cost.
Applications of biomechanics in clinical, occupational and recreational areas are presented. Highlights include access to Neuroscience Research Australia's state-of-the-art 3D motion capture lab for the MoCap laboratory sessions. Delivery is in-person. Mechanics of the human body offer the best possible learning and teaching experience with a focus on hands on and in-person learning experiences supported by online content that enables every student to progress and achieve at their preferred pace.
