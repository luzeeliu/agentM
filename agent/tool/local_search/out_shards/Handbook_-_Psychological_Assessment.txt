Psychological Assessment 1 teaches candidates how to use, administer and interpret major psychological tests, including the Wechsler Intelligence and Memory scales and other tests used routinely to assess cognition. It also addresses issues in determining real and unusual differences in test scores and communication of assessment findings.
It is assumed that candidates will have covered topics to do with test validity and reliability in prior courses.
This course entails theoretical and practical components presented in a series of 1 hour lectures and 2 hour practicals. The course covers fundamental issues for candidates training to become Clinical Psychologists. Case examples throughout the course are provided to ensure relevance is clear.
Teaching strategies of PSYC7001 encourage candidates to think and act as professional interns. Material covering important theoretical and practical knowledge, general principles in assessment and particular methodological issues to do with test instruments will be covered in lectures. Specific skills in tests and assessment procedures will be taught in practical tutorials. Test interpretation and report writing will be taught via programmed assignment work or other activities in the tutorials.
Candidates are encouraged to work both independently and in small groups to learn test administration and test interpretation. While tutorial time will focus upon teaching skills in targeted assessment procedures, it is expected that candidates will practice these techniques outside formal teaching hours in order to reach a criterion level of competency. Candidates should also make use of the Test Library, to acquaint themselves with different kinds of tests available for assessment that are not necessarily covered in the course.
