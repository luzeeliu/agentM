Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a vital part of the aviation industry, as it enables aircraft operators to meet their planned times of departure and arrival, and adhere to their preferred flight profiles with minimum constraints and without compromising agreed levels of safety. The principal stakeholder groups in today’s air transport industry are the end-users; customers in terms of passengers and freight, the airspace users, the aerodrome community, the Air Navigation Service Providers and the supply industry. This course looks at the industry from an air traffic management perspective and through the eyes of an Air Navigation Service Provider to provide an overview of the impacts of ATM on the end-user as a part of aviation systems and processes.
This fully online course introduces students to ATM-related topics including automation, human factors, safety and training, environmental impacts, ATM efficiency, and the future of ATM. Through case studies and assessments that draw on real world or simulated real world situations, students are provided with opportunities to problem-solve aviation issues from an ATM perspective.

The course is delivered electronically via UNSW Moodle, on a distance-learning basis, allowing students to study at their own pace, in accordance with their particular work schedules and locations. It is expected that students need to spend at least 10 hours per week on completing required readings and activities for the course, in addition to the completion of assessments and self-directed study. Additional time may be required during the assessment submission period. Although the bulk of the course is self-paced, there is an expectation for students to submit their assessments by the specified due dates and according to instructions provided in the course.
