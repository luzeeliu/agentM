By taking this course, you will gain an appreciation of Australia’s rich and complex Aboriginal linguistic heritage in contemporary and traditional contexts. You will delve into a curated range of topics including language and the land, kinship and social organisation, narrative and conversation, language acquisition, language contact, language and education, language maintenance and revival. Each of these topics will be discussed with reference to engaging case studies of current research and current community-based projects. Through the exploration of these topics, you will learn about the characteristic linguistic properties of Australian languages and apply analytical skills to the description of Australian language data. There will be a focus on how new ways of speaking are created, how languages are lost, and the ways in which Aboriginal speakers are teaching and reviving their traditional languages today. You will work with a selection of authentic NSW Aboriginal language material from State Library of NSW collections. In doing so, you will have hands-on experience in how to find and utilise rich archival linguistic material and the ethical practices in the management and use of Aboriginal language materials. You will take away from this course a deepened understanding of social and cultural diversity as seen through the lens of language, analytical methods and critical thinking skills, and knowledge of research ethics and intellectual integrity.
