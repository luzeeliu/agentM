Description
This course offers an introduction to the strategies engaged by advertisers, and to the role that advertising plays in consumer culture.  There is a focus on the nuanced theory and strategic thinking behind the messages we consume daily.
You will explore social, cultural, literary, and visual communication theories that may be engaged to understand and critique individual advertisements, and you will also learn how to analyse the sometimes very subtle strategies behind full-scale advertising campaigns.
