The Honours year provides students with an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of econometrics and to develop the necessary skills to tackle the economic and econometric issues and challenges that they will encounter throughout their careers. Students learn and put into practice the skills needed to conduct an independent and original research project and to communicate and defend the results of the research. Graduates with an Honours degree from the School of Economics at UNSW have moved on to successful careers in both the public and private sectors and academia.
The Economics Honours program with specialisation in Econometrics is designed for students with the equivalent of a BEc degree with a major in Econometrics. There are prerequisite courses for the Econometrics Honours degree which students must complete prior to their Honours year.
To satisfy the Honours requirements, students complete an additional year of study, including Honours level courses (both compulsory and elective) and a research thesis in econometrics. Full-time and part-time (during 3 semesters) study is available in this program. Mid-year entry to the BEc(Hons) is possible, but is typically recommended only for part-time study.
