An understanding of the law and legal systems, and how they impact aviation is fundamental for an aviation professional to meaningfully and consideringly carry out daily operational tasks and carefully consider approaches to various aviation challenges. Aviation law is found in numerous legislative enactments, although it derives, particularly in respect of regulation and licensing, from international law sources: Conventions, rules, standard practices, accords and arrangements of more or less formal standing, implemented and supplemented by municipal legislation, some of which is applied by regulatory agencies exercising licensing and other controls over not only the operational (safety and technical) aspects of air navigation, but also over some commercial practices and functions, especially for international air services.
This course focuses on providing students with a deeper understanding of contemporary aviation law and associated regulations by focusing in greater detail aspects of the course content covered in AVIA2401 - Aviation Law and Regulations. This includes developing students' understanding of international law and sovereignty in a dynamic, changing aviation climate. The course will also explore the impact of the legal system on aviation with consideration of international laws, standards and recommended practices and how they are embedded at a local state level. In alignment with considering the impact of international law in a local aviation context, the inclusion of lectures delivered by aviation experts, case-study learning, and assessments related to real world scenarios encourages students to "think global and act local!".
