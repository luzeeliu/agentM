The Graduate Certificate in Information Technology is designed for students who wish to develop and expand their knowledge and skills in Information Technology.
The aim of this award is to provide qualified students with an opportunity to study advanced topics in Information Technology to complement or update their existing qualifications, and for those with no background in Information Technology at all, an opportunity to undertake introductory-level courses before considering a higher level qualification in this discipline.
The program articulates to the Graduate Diploma in Information Technology program with full credit for courses completed in the Graduate Certificate program. Students may exit from this proposed program with a Graduate Certificate award if they have completed the required course requirements.
