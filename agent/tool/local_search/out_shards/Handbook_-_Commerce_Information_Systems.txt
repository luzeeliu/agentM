This 4 year double degree program leads to the award of a
Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Information Systems (BCom/BIS)
and will meet the needs of students who want a strong, focused and highly regarded business degree combined with an Information Systems degree. Organisations value business savvy IS graduates who understand the business and technical issues which surround and impact their information systems. As part of the degree program students will complete a major in both Information Systems (IS) and within the UNSW Business School.
In selecting their combination of majors, students should note that while there is a wide range of choice, not every combination may be able to be completed in 4 years of full-time study.
