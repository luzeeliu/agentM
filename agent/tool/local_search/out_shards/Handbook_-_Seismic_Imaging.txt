Seismic imaging is a key to determining the properties and structures in the Earth and important for mapping faults, the interface between bedrock and sediment and structures within rocks. In this course, you will engage in activities that align with what would be expected of a seismic geophysicist in industry. The topics covered take students from introductory seismology to advanced concepts in seismic attributes and inversion. A number of the concepts are taught using python without requiring prerequisite knowledge: as a result you will also gain programming skills, which are of growing demand in industry. Finally, the course will focus on communicating geophysical methods and results to an interdisciplinary audience. The main topics are understanding seismic data and images, how waves propagate through the subsurface and how to do 3D seismic interpretation.
