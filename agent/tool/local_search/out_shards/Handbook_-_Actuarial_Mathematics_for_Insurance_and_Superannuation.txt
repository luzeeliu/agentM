Long-term contingent cashflow valuation is fundamental for actuarial work, especially for life-, disability- and health insurance, pensions and superannuation. They are also increasingly applied in broader areas in social protection and policy. This course introduces models and techniques from actuarial mathematics combining the present value principles with stochastic modelling, in order to derive the value of contingent cashflows for pricing, reserving, projections and profit testing purposes. The course also covers contemporary management issues in life, health and superannuation products such as longevity, and premium rating. Spreadsheets will be used to perform computations.
