This subject takes an international perspective on ecological and social inequity and other global challenges, focusing on ongoing impacts of colonisation, the role of environmental conventions and trade rules, and the impact of global governance strategies such as the “sustainable development goals.” This course will be of particular interest if you are concerned with issues of global inequality, environmental justice, and the roles of the state and civil society. In this course, you will explore the environmental challenges that face the “Global South” and engage in a productive critique of neoliberal models of economic growth and development that underlie these challenges. The course provides you with an understanding of the historical, political, and international contexts within which issues of environment and “development” are framed, governed, and (in some cases) addressed. You will consider the social and environmental impacts and implications of global value chains and production networks, as well as efforts to undertake more ethical and sustainable approaches. You will engage in case studies and learn about applied, practical, and reflexive approaches for addressing globally interlinked issues facing the “Global South,” or “majority world.”
