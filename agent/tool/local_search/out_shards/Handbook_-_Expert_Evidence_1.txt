Expert Evidence offers students an in-depth exploration of the role of expert evidence in contemporary civil and criminal trials within Australia and other common law jurisdictions. Students will engage in analysis and critical reflection of modern approaches to expert evidence, gaining a comprehensive understanding of both substantive admissibility and procedural rules.
The course also examines the diverse and sometimes conflicting methods of interpreting scientific evidence in legal contexts. By integrating insights from various multidisciplinary perspectives, students will appreciate the richness of contemporary critical theory and scientific analysis and learn to apply these insights to real-world legal scenarios involving expert opinion evidence.
This course is particularly beneficial for those considering legal practice, as it considers the selection of appropriate experts, the integration of expert evidence into persuasive case construction, and the critical deconstruction of judgments dealing with the admissibility of expert opinion evidence.
