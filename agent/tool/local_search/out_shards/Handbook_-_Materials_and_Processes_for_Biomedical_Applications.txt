This Level 4 elective course in materials science and engineering introduces students to various classes of biomaterials, including polymeric, metallic, ceramic, and composite materials for use in advanced medical technologies.
The first part of the course covers the physical, chemical, and biological properties of these materials, especially in the context of material biocompatibility. These concepts are taught through topical case studies highlighting the importance of material selection for optimal performance at the tissue interface. In the second part of the course, students are introduced to material design and selection criteria in terms of biofabrication techniques that are revolutionizing the field of medical devices and therapeutics. The course also includes hands-on lab activities designed as a practical companion to the lectures, enabling the student to experience technology-enhanced learning.
The course includes face-to-face lectures, laboratory classes, project work and an exam.
Knowledge of the processing-structure-property relationships of metals, ceramics, polymers, and their composites is recommended.
