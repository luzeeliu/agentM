This is a foundational (Level 1) Information Systems (IS) course that introduces students to the use of IS in business and society. As an overarching theme, DPBS1602 examines the issues and management of IS in relation to human behaviour and its consequences. Through this course, students will learn to appreciate existing and emerging technologies affecting businesses, business relationships and their products and services. In taking this course, students will be provided with tasks and assignments that will aid in refining their professional business skills and the ability to evaluate the value of technology to businesses. This includes communication and group work skills, time management and research skills.
The topics that are covered in DPBS1602 include understanding the role of Information Systems and IS Professionals in Global Business, the relationship between Information Systems, Organisations, and Strategy, the dominant Business Models enabled by the Internet and Web 2.0 technology. The course will also explore contemporary technology enabled phenomena that are disruptive to the current business landscape. The course also touches on popular enterprise-level information systems such as Enterprise Systems, Supply Chain and Customer Relationship Management Systems and the emergence of business intelligence in supporting organisation decision making. The course also involves discussion of the considerations behind the acquisition and building of IS and the issues common to the management of IS projects. Lastly, the course addresses the need to secure the IS and the potential ethical and social issues faced by businesses in relation to their use of IS.
