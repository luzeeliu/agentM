This course teaches the essential methods in analytical chemistry applicable to chemists, biologists, and most other disciplines of science. The course covers methods for treating analytical data including: estimation of uncertainties, chromatography and other separation techniques, the applications of spectroscopy (UV/Visible absorption, infrared, fluorescence, NMR and mass spectrometry) to analysis and electrochemistry (including pH measurements). These analytical techniques will be applied to solving chemical structure problems and interesting applications of these techniques will be covered (e.g., gene and protein sequencing and metal speciation in environmental samples). The course involves lectures, labs and tutorials.
