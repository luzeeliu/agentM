This course introduces you to the theory and practice of Australian foreign policy across a range of key relationships and policy areas in both historical and contemporary terms. You will consider the domestic and global contexts of Australia’s foreign policy and the ways in which they shape Australia’s international behaviour. You will explore a range of significant policy areas, including defence and national security, trade, foreign aid, and immigration. The emphasis is on developing a critical understanding of Australian foreign policy, Australia's international interests and the ways in which those interests are pursued. You are encouraged to address the subject through critical reflection and debate, drawing where possible on current issues in foreign policy development and practice.
