Most scholars, policy-makers and governance practitioners argue that ‘globalisation’ exists and is important, but not all offer a clear understanding of what globalisation means for contemporary world politics. This course will enable you to understand and analyse the types, structures and methods of governance at the global level through exploration of the nature, impacts and future of globalised life. Themes of global governance (including international security, globalised economic relations, regionalism, human rights, the development regime, and humanitarian intervention) are addressed in relation to what it means to question the nature and function of power, authority and global cooperation in international relations. In particular, you will explore certain political and ‘policy’ debates behind issues such as international aid, foreign debt, structural adjustment, environmental degradation, as well as the role and effects of NGOs, international organisations and the wider international community. The course will particularly focus on introducing you to critical approaches to globalisation and global governance, and you will be asked to examine a variety of issues, questions and concerns raised by the study of governance and the implications of these issues for global politics.
Subject Area: Politics and International Relations.
