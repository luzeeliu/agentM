Experience an exciting learning adventure with our Radio Frequency Circuit Design and Applications course! This course will serve as a launching pad for those interested in high-frequency technology innovation. Our inquiry-based learning methods prioritise "learning-by-doing" and putting theoretical concepts into practical use. By attending the laboratories, you will gather unique data to identify real issues and meet practical radio frequency engineering problems. You will also learn how to conduct comprehensive electrical and electromagnetic circuit analysis, literature review, and patent searches while developing your communication skills.
This course integrates high-frequency electromagnetics, electronics, and technology knowledge. You will be able to apply theoretical concepts to real-life scenarios and develop a comprehensive project brief that showcases your skills in consolidating and communicating critical, radio frequency engineering problems. Embark on an engaging learning journey and take the first step towards your career in radio frequency theory, technology, and design with us!
Course content includes: Review of transceiver architectures; RF basics: transmission lines; Smith charts; S-parameters; RF active/passive devices and parasitics; RF and microwave technologies; Linearity and noise. Impedance matching; RF resonators;  RF filters: designing and implementation of microstrip line filters, Richard's transformations, Kuroda identities; LNA: circuit architectures, impedance, noise, bandwidth, power gain; Design for maximum gain, particular gain and particular noise figure.
