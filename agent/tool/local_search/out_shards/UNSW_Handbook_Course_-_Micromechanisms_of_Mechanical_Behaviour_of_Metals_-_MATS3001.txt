Description
Theoretical strength; slip; twinning; deformation of single and polycrystals; dislocation multiplication; cross slip; climb; dislocation interactions. Strain hardening; solid solution hardening; age‐hardening; dispersion hardening; grain size strengthening; other strengthening mechanisms. High temperature deformation; creep; stress relaxation; effect of strain rate and temperature; superplasticity. Common methods of forming metal products. Common classes of aluminium and nickel‐based and titanium alloys to be taught illustrating some of the principles involved.
