The Master of Laws by Coursework (LLM) offers an opportunity for graduates to expand and deepen the scope of their legal expertise.  The flexible structure of the LLM allows for the tailoring of each student’s journey to account for personal areas of interest.  ​
​The program emphasises a mix of domestic, international and comparative perspectives. Students select eight courses (which may include core courses for some students) from a list of law and cross-disciplinary courses. During the program, students will develop their expert knowledge, their legal skills, and their research skills. ​
​Postgraduate courses are delivered in a range of formats and modes throughout the year, including courses spread across the term, and others taught more intensively. It is primarily run as a face-to-face program with a range of online and hybrid options. ​
Courses and their timing will vary each year to take account of student interest and the availability of expert teachers. Not every course within the LLM is offered annually.​
