Should I run or walk in the rain? Why did Nelson win the Battle of Trafalgar? How will Earth’s climate evolve in the future?
Mathematical Modelling for Real World Systems is both for Mathematics and Statistics majors interested in how mathematics is applied and students from other fields looking for an overview of mathematical tools with practical applications.
Motivated by real world problems, the course will survey mathematical techniques for: achieving the best possible outcomes, predicting future events and dealing with uncertainties. The course will provide introductions to data fitting, discrete time systems, simulation modelling, dimensional analysis and numerical simulation and involve substantial development of differential equations and systems of differential equations.
Real world applications include:
- Biology (e.g. cell growth and population dynamics)
- Health (e.g. drug delivery and infectious diseases);
- Finance;
- Environment and Climate Change.
As part of the course requirements, students will be expected to work in groups on mathematical modelling projects and prepare a group report, both written and oral, describing the project. The course aims to equip students with the modelling skills and presentation skills for dealing with real world problems. The course involves weekly lectures and tutorials in the earlier parts of the term, transitioning to group work and seminar sessions towards the end of term.
