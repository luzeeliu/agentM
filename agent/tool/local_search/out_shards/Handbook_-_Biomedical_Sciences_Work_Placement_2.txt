This course is the second of the School of Biomedical Sciences (SBMS) work placement courses and builds on the skills and experiences gained in SOMS3199 Biomedical Sciences Work Placement 1.
SOMS3199 must be completed as a co-requisite or pre-requisite to SOMS3299.
This work placement course is for SBMS students who wish to extend their work placement experience by either a) completing a second 6 UOC work placement in a SBMS discipline, b) a more intensive placement (more hours in one term), or c) completing a longer work placement (over two terms). Placements may be paid or unpaid. The three work placement options available to SOMS3299 students are provided below -  the same eligibility and approval processes apply for all work placement options.
Option A:
Having previously completed SOMS3199, a second 105-hour placement completed in 1 term; enrolment pattern = SOMS3199; total of 6 UOC
Option B:
210-hour placement completed in 1 term; enrolment pattern = SOMS3199 and SOMS3299 in the same term; total of 12 UOC
Option C:
210-hour placement completed over 2 terms; enrolment pattern = SOMS3199 in one term and SOMS3299 in the following term; total of 12 UOC
In completing an extended or intensive option, students will have the opportunity to further develop professional workplace skills and engage in deeper self-reflection and analysis of the experience as a stepping stone into a graduate career.
SOMS3299 will count as a science or free elective and is graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. The course is available to domestic and international students. If a domestic or international student wishes to undertake an overseas work placement, extra conditions will apply before the placement and enrolment into the course is approved.
