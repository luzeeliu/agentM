The course is presented as 2 strands. The first strand is concerned with transport planning concepts and fundamentals of traffic theory.   The transport planning component dwells on technical applications related to interactions between transport, land use and the environment. Topics include: introduction to four step transport planning process, transport network principles and their applications, transport demand models and sustainable transport strategies. The traffic theory component introduces basics of traffic engineering relationships, performance characteristics of roads, traffic management and delay computations in relation to unsignalised intersections and roundabouts. This strand is allocated approximately 2/3 of teaching content and is common for both Civil and Environmental Engineering students.
The second strand is specifically for Environmental students. This strand focuses on the environmental impacts of transport and sustainable development. Topics include: assessment of environmental and community impacts from traffic noise, vehicle emissions and air pollution. It also includes EIA of major transport projects, concepts of transport policy, international trends and sustainable transport.
