This course examines research and theory on memory. The focus is primarily on animal research but the application of this work to the understanding of memory in humans will be made explicit. For example, the implications of this work for our understanding of memory disorders in humans, and the origin and treatment of clinical disorders will be discussed. The laboratory component of the course will provide “hands on” experience in observing various aspects of rodent behaviour that are frequently used in studies on the psychobiology of memory and an opportunity for small group discussion/debate on various issues relevant to the material described in the lecture component of the course.
The course is particularly designed for students interested in the general area of behavioural neuroscience who may be interested in understanding how research is conducted in this area of psychology.
