.
The Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) is a professionally oriented, truly interdisciplinary program taught as a joint initiative between the Schools of Chemistry and Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences (Faculty of Science), and the Pharmacology section of the School of Biomedical Sciences (Faculty of Medicine).
Medicinal Chemistry is an exciting, rapidly-expanding area within the broad discipline of Chemistry that has seen enormous growth recently both within Australia and globally. It is, quite simply, the development of new pharmaceutical agents, from Concept to Clinic. Many different stages are involved; from the design and synthesis of novel drug candidates, to their biochemical effects, testing regimes and regulatory and ethical considerations. The Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program has been designed to ensure that graduates have a strong background in contemporary biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, based upon a solid foundation of essential chemistry.
Graduates from the Medicinal Chemistry(Honours) program are equipped with a unique and wide harmony of skills, ranging from fundamental chemistry enabling the synthesis and analysis of drug candidates, through to relevant pharmacology and molecular biology skills. This combination means graduates are in high demand both locally and globally in pharmaceutical companies involved in modern drug design. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of the program means that graduates are highly marketable within other science-based industries and related fields. The research focus in the Honours year, which provides projects that emphasise the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the area also enables students to progress seamlessly into a higher degree if they wish.
Graduates obtain a broad education across a range of relevant scientific areas, as well as a strong grounding in advanced biological and chemical techniques. There is a particular emphasis on the medical sciences. The first year of the program provides solid foundation knowledge in some fundamental areas of science, chemistry, mathematics, and biology- as well as specific graduate attributes courses. Years two and three focus on chemistry, pharmacology, and biochemistry, with a number of recommended electives to broaden a student's knowledge in relevant fields (physiology, anatomy, genetics). The fourth (Honours) year provides a substantial research experience.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.

Program Requirements
Progression Requirements
Progression to stage 4 is subject to academic performance, and requires completion of a total of 144 UOC and all the requirements of the first three years of the program, including level I, core and elective courses, and General Education requirements. Students are expected to have attained an overall WAM of 65 or higher to be eligible to continue to Honours. Students who are ineligible to progress to Honours will be transferred to the Bachelor of Science program (3970) and graduate with the Bachelor of Science award at pass level.
Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry (Honours) program who wish to take out the Bachelor of Science award at pass level without proceeding to Honours, may also request to exit with a Bachelor of Science, Medicinal Chemistry exit major (CHEMM13970). Applications for early exit should be lodged with Student Services during the final term prior to honours.

University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
Honours Grades are awarded as follows:-
Honours Class 1: mark or weighted average of 85 or greater;
Honours Class 2 Division 1: mark or weighted average from 75 to 84;
Honours Class 2 Division 2: mark or weighted average from 65 to 74;
Honours Class 3: mark or weighted average below 65;
A student's Honours Grading is calculated only on their performance in the final year of the program. The final honours grading is calculated as follows:-
Introductory proposal and viva - 10%
Coursework - 10%
Thesis - 50%
Seminar - 10%
Final Viva - 20%
Additional Information
University Medal
Nominees for the University Medal will be determined by Schools within the Faculty of Science in accordance with UNSW University Medal policies and procedures. The top student in any year may be eligible for nomination for a University medal however additional criteria will also need to be met, such as Honours result > 95%, and WAM in Stages 1 to 3 of over 80%.

Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing section below for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
