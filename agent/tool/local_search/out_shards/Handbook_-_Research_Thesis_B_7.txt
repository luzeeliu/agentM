This course is the second of two parts and is undertaken after the completion of CVEN4040 Research Thesis A in the following term. Successful completion of Parts A and B are required to obtain the equivalent of 12 units of credit.
The Honours Research Thesis may describe directed research work on an approved subject and will be completed under the guidance and supervision of a member of the academic staff. The research may involve a directed laboratory or field investigation, analytical or numerical modelling, a detailed design, literature review or such other individual research project approved by the Head of School. Part A involves the satisfactory formulation of the literature review, the definition of the research problem, completion of a significant part of the research and the development of thesis outline. Part B involves the review of the literature; execution of the research project; discussion and critique of the results; completion and submission of the thesis report and a presentation of the project results to peers.
