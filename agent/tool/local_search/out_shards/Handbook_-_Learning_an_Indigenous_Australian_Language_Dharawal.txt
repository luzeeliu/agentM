This course is an introduction to Dharawal, an Aboriginal language of East Coast NSW which is being reclaimed by its custodians. It will be taught by community language practitioners from the Dharawal Language Program, a community-led language reclamation program. The course will provide you with basic skills in speaking, understanding, reading and writing Dharawal. This knowledge will be culturally and historically situated. This will allow you to develop an understanding of the relationship between people, language and Country, the importance of language to the community, and the context in which Dharawal is being reclaimed. This course will involve field trips to La Perouse Aboriginal Community and will provide you with a unique learning experience and opportunity to engage with a local Indigenous initiative.
