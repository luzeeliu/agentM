The media reflects our world—and also influences and shapes our understanding of it. In this course you will be introduced to key media principles and writing practices that will empower you to inform, persuade, and entertain. The course will cover a range of genres and roles in both the public relations and advertising and journalism and communications fields. You will learn the fundamentals of the media release, copywriting, blogging, posting, journalistic prose, and news story structure.
You will develop a portfolio of skills useful across media and communications. So that material is newsworthy, you will learn how to structure and edit content and to develop angles that will engage readers. You will also learn about balance, bias, and ethics. Accordingly, this course will help you to think critically about the social, economic, and political role of your work.
