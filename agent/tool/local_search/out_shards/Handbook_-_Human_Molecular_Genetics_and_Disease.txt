Personal genomics is revolutionising medicine. Soon, everyone in Australia is likely to have their genome sequenced at birth. What does this mean for how we see ourselves and treat disease? Is our future written in our genes, or can we influence and control our genetic destiny? This course explores the central principles and applications of understanding our genetic makeup and how this is transforming biomedical science. Core concepts and methods in molecular genetics will be introduced and applied to a variety of topics on human evolution, development and disease. Students will examine the roles of “nature” versus “nurture”, including epigenetic regulation, and learn how developments in genome technology are opening new avenues for personalised medicine. Lectures will be supported by laboratory and bioinformatics practicals using modern research methods and data. Skills developed during these practicals will provide excellent training for any students considering an Honours project in molecular bioscience.
