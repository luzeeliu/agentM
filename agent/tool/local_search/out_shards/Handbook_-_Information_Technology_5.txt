The Information Technology specialisation in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs is the most flexible of all specialisations. It allows students to select courses in a very broad range of specialised areas and prepare them for positions in the IT industry. The specialisation also enables students to gain a good overview of the possible specialisations before nominating a specific specialisation to develop expertise in a particular field.
This specialisation is particularly suited to professionals who seek higher positions and can devote one or two years to broadening their technical knowledge of the IT industry before they return to their professional activities.
This specialisation is suitable for students who prefer maximum flexibility in the courses they select, and it is the default plan for all new enrolments in the program.
The aim of this specialisation is to provide students with a broad-based IT education, enabling them to work in a range of positions in the IT industry.
