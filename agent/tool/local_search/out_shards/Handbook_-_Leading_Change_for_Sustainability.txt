Leading Change for Sustainability is a course designed for future leaders who are passionate about creating positive social and environmental change.
Your ideas and passion for sustainability and resilience are just the first step. You need skills in leadership, creativity, systems thinking, communication and models for cultural change so that you can influence key decision-makers, build networks and make your idea a reality. You need an awareness of change processes and an understanding of ethics and human rights to lead sustainable change, locally and globally.
How do you support cultural change towards a sustainable future for all organisational types?
How do you pursue social and environmental goals from within a multinational company or a start up?
Sustainability has become a key driver in many organisations, from large foundations to social enterprises, not-for-profits working with government to provide services, and small to large businesses. This course explores how to create and implement sustainability strategies for different organisational types. We take a broad view of sustainability based on the Sustainable Development Goals, acknowledging the human, social, economic and environmental elements of positive cultural change.
