This Multi-Crew Cooperation course is intended for third-year UNSW Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) students who are already licensed pilots. Multi-crew cooperation is the set of procedures, techniques, and interactions that enable pilots to operate, as a crew member, on transport category aeroplanes in the safest and most efficient way. This course builds on the knowledge and skills gained from single-pilot operations, by expanding the scope to multi-crew operations skills that are essential for students who aspire to a career as a professional pilot.
Students are provided with the opportunity to learn the foundational knowledge and practical flight instruction required for the award of the multi-crew cooperation course completion certificate, which is required by legislation to operate as a pilot in multi-crew operations. Key topics are non-technical skills, including human factors; crew resource management; standard operating procedures; transport category aeroplane systems; and the practical techniques and crew interactions necessary to achieve safe and efficient flight.
These topics are explored through interactive lectures and guided discussions for underpinning knowledge plus simulated flights in a Boeing 737 PS4.5 fixed base, fully enclosed Flight Training Device.
The course is intensive mode to provide the best learning outcomes and provides a high level of practical experience guided by experienced airline pilots. All learning is conducted at the UNSW Aviation Flying Operations Unit at Bankstown Airport.
