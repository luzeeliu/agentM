The Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) is the degree of choice for innovative thinkers with exceptional scientific knowledge and skills. This is a program designed for talented students and offers the flexibility to tailor the degree in a way that works for them. The degree offers students access to advanced level courses and includes an Honours year. Students will study foundation courses, which may include areas such as biology, chemistry, physics and maths, before choosing a major and really exploring what inspires them most. In their fourth year, students undertake Honours which involves a supervised research project and in some cases, advanced coursework. Outstanding Honours students may continue their studies in a higher research degree.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.
Special Admission Requirements
Expand all
Other
keyboard_arrow_down
Some Schools within the Faculty may grant students exemption from  completing particular first year courses. Where an exemption is given  this is not added to a student's academic record and hence does not  reduce the total units of credit the student must complete for the  program. The exemption merely grants a student the ability to undertake  higher level courses (such as second year courses) that require the  exempted course as a prerequisite. Students with an exemption will need  to be manually enrolled in higher year courses by administrative staff.

Progression Requirements
Progression to Stage 4 (the honours year) of this program is subject to academic performance.
Where students successfully complete a total of 144 UoC and all the requirements of the first three stages of the program, including Level I/II/III, major, and general education requirements, they can apply for entry into the Stage 4 honours component. Entry criteria for honours in each School can be found here
https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/study-us/undergraduate/honours-degrees/honours-how-apply
If a student is not permitted to progress in the Advanced Science (Honours) they will be required to transfer to, and graduate from, program 3970 Bachelor of Science. Students should be aware that not all Advanced Science (Honours) majors are available in 3970, meaning that graduation in 3970 may occur in a less specialised major. Entry to Honours may still be possible by application to enter program 4500 Bachelor of Science (Honours).
Students enrolled in the Advanced Science (Honours) program who wish to take out the Bachelor of Science award at pass level without proceeding to Honours, are required to transfer to the Science program (3970). Applications to transfer should be lodged with Science Student Services no later than the census date for the term in which the student expects to satisfy requirements. Students applying after that date may not be able to graduate in the next round of ceremonies.

University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
Students completing Honours will be considered for the award of Honours according to the following scale (based on performance in Stage 4 and the calculation described in the particular discipline area):
Honours Class 1: mark or weighted average of 85 or greater;
Honours Class 2 Division 1: mark or weighted average from 75 to 84;
Honours Class 2 Division 2: mark or weighted average from 65 to 74;
Honours Class 3: mark or weighted average below 65;
A student's Honours Grading is calculated only on their performance in the final year of the program. Each School has its own method for calculating Honours gradings and this is clearly articulated at a stream level in the Handbook.
Additional Information
University Medal
Nominees for the University Medal will be determined by Schools within the Faculty of Science in accordance with UNSW University Medal policies and procedures.
Definition of 'Science' courses
Courses that are classified as 'Science' can be found under Table 1 on the
Science Terminology
page.
Talented Students' Program and Accelerated Progression
The Science
Talented Students' Program (TSP)
introduces high performing students - entering the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) - to the Faculty of Science and helps them develop specific skills during their degree. The program offers these students exposure to research within the Faculty and provides a degree that is flexible and tailored to suit students' needs and talents.
Invitation to participate in the TSP is made by the Dean of Science on the basis of superior secondary education performance (ATAR or equivalent), all incoming students are assessed for eligibility including non-high school leavers. High performing current UNSW Science students, in the BSc or BAdvSci(Hons), will be invited to join at the end of their first year. Contact the Science Student Centre for more details.
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
Faculty General Rules and Requirements
page.
Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing sections above for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
