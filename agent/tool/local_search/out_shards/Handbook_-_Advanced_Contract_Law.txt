This elective course, assumes and builds upon knowledge and understanding of basic contract law derived in particular from the course pre-requisites. It introduces students to some of the more sophisticated principles of contract law which are of particular relevance to the practical use and application of contract law in the commercial world, including in particular conditionality of promises, dependency of promises, the various categories of breach and their effects, the various bases for termination of contracts, limits on the same and consequences of the same. Teaching is primarily by reference to a selected range of leading Australian and English appellate decisions, and supported by a series of handouts which set out and discuss the principles which are established and/or illustrated by those cases.
