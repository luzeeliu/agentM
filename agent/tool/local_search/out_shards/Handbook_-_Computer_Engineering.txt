Computer Engineering encompasses the structured and integrated design of the hardware and software components of computerised systems. Not only do personal computer systems, such as desktops and laptops fall into this category, but so do embedded systems for gaming, cars and PDAs, supercomputers used in climate modelling and gene analysis, and prosthetic systems such as ocular implants intended to improve quality of life. The challenge for the engineer is to design these systems with maximal impact, and to trade off competing factors using engineering, scientific and mathematical principles. This specialisation teaches the principles and techniques necessary to engineer high quality systems.
Computer Engineering is studied as a major specialisation in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours).
