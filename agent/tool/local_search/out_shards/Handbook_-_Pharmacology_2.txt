Can you imagine a world without therapeutic drugs? Whether to treat a headache or to cure cancer, drugs play an integral role in our lives. Pharmacology is the science that examines the effect of drugs on biological systems, from understanding the molecular level interactions by which drugs work, through to their effects in people. Pharmacologists research and develop new drugs, improve our understanding of how drugs work, identify individuals that could most benefit from a given drug, and make sure drugs are effective and safe.   There is a huge range of potential career pathways for pharmacologists, including academic science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry roles, medical science roles, and regulatory administration. Pharmacologists are therefore at the forefront of modern medicine, allowing us to treat diseases safely and effectively.
