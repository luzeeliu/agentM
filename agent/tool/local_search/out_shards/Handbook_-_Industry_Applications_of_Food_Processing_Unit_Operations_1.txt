Food engineering principles (heat and mass transfer) are the basis of food processing. In this course, you will understand and apply important aspects of food engineering in greater depth, focussing on selected unit operations such as drying, spray drying, distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, extrusion, and radiation. By undertaking this course, you will be well equipped with the fundamental theory to understand many common processes undertaken in the food processing industry. This includes heat and mass transfer, radiation theory, drying and dehydration, and chemical separations.
At the end of this course, you should have a greater knowledge of these specialised unit operations, and how they might interact with food and its quality. In addition, you should have improved problem-solving skills and the ability to bring analytical techniques to each unit operation. You should also have a greater awareness of where to find resources to help with unit operation analysis applicable to a range of food-related industries. These knowledge and skills will be valuable for careers in the food industry including food (process) engineer, food technologist, new product developer, and other R&D positions.
