This course provides students with an introduction to the key elements of neutron physics within a nuclear reactor. Students completing this course will be able to discuss aspects of reactor physics and the implications that reactor physics has on the engineering and safety of nuclear systems. Students will be able to perform analyses on simple reactor geometries and describe and understand the main kinetic mechanisms, and their significance, on reactor design and control. Analytical and computational techniques will be used by the student to solve neutron physics problems.
A review of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is presented to highlight the link between neutron physics and reactor safety. Key concepts such as neutron flux and diffusion are first introduced. These are then utilised to demonstrate multiplication and criticality. The neutron life cycle in thermal reactors is described along with fast and delayed neutron production. Reactor kinetics are discussed including doubling times, reactivity feedback mechanisms, power and temperature coefficients, and Xenon poisoning.
The course material is highly technical in nature. Students taking this course are expected to have the mathematical skills of second year engineering students, so that they are able manipulate and solve the mathematical expressions inherent to neutron physics problems. Students are expected to be familiar with coding principles so that they can operate codes on high performance computers to solve neutron physics problems. Students must also have completed an introductory course on Nuclear Engineering prior to this course, as the material builds on the physical processes at work during fission including neutron flux, criticality, moderation, reactor dynamics and transients.
