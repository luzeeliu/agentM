Biocompatibility involves understanding how materials and medical devices interact with living tissues and biological systems without causing harm. In this course, you will delve into the world of medical devices, biomaterials, and tissue engineering, gaining insights into designing biocompatible medical devices.
Through a combination of lectures, activities, and independent tasks, you will explore biomaterials, predicting their reactions in biological systems. You will understand tissue engineering principles and apply them to innovate medical device design. We'll delve into how material processing, sterilisation, and handling impact medical device functionality, and examine host responses to biomaterials, predicting reactions to novel device designs. Finally, you will learn to propose testing regimes for new medical devices.
The course will challenge you with practical case studies, encouraging problem-solving and innovation in the biocompatibility field. By the end, you will be equipped with essential knowledge, practical skills, and a lifelong interest in contributing to the dynamic field of biomedical engineering.
