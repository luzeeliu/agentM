The project provides an opportunity for you to bring together engineering principles learned over your previous years of study and apply these principles to innovatively solve problems such as the development of a specific design, process and/or the investigation of a hypothesis. Master projects are complex, open-ended problems that allow room for your creativity, and the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. There are multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning. The project requires you to formulate problems in scientific or engineering terms, manage an technical project and find solutions by applying scientific and engineering methods. You will also develop the ability to work in a research and development environment. You must identify a supervisor and project prior to enrolling in this course. This is the first course of the 3 course project structure.
