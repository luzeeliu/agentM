This specialisation is for students commencing from 2026.
The Computational Design specialisation in the Bachelor of Design is the nexus of architecture and design with engineering and science all through a profound understanding of computing and computation.
Technology has infiltrated all aspects of design, across different contexts and scales ranging from print to object to the built environment.
This three-year specialisation degree focuses on applying state of the art thinking in design, architecture and urbanism with theories and knowledge from engineering and science together with frontier skills in computer programming, emerging digital technologies, and digital and robotic fabrication tools.
The resulting creative, technical and aesthetic solutions are taught in individual interlinked modules educating you with knowledge and skills to become agents of change and future citizens.
The degree offers unique skills on the application of digital technologies in design disciplines and the built environment to face the challenges of the 21st century.
