Notes:
Courses numbered from MATH3000 to MATH3799 or MATH6700 to MATH6899 inclusive are non-statistics Mathematics courses.
Notes
Students majoring in Mathematics are strongly recommended to take MATH2301 or an equivalent course in practical numerical computing.
Many courses in Mathematics are offered at two levels. The higher level courses cater for students with greater mathematical ability and/or a higher level of prior knowledge. Students with suitable qualifications are encouraged to enrol in the corresponding higher level courses.
Students who are completing the Bachelor Science (majoring in Mathematics) in concurrent mode with a Bachelor of Engineering will need to substitute some level II courses in the Engineering program. For more information see this document:

Honours
Students interested in undertaking Honours in Applied or Pure Mathematics must take at least 30 UoC of Stage III Applied or Pure Mathematics courses in order to be eligible. Please consult the School of Mathematics and Statistics for advice on choosing the right courses.
