The major in Materials Science combines principles from physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology to understand and manipulate materials at the atomic and molecular level for developing new materials or improving existing ones for various applications of benefit to society. It is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that underpins technological advancements by providing the foundation for the development of new materials with improved performance, functionality, and sustainability.  As such, materials science plays a crucial role in advancing technologies in fields such as electronics, renewable energy, transportation, and medicine.  Along with a solid scientific and technical foundation, the major equips students with research, communication, project management, time management, and computing skills that prepares them for a fulfilling career as a professional materials scientist in research, industry or government sectors.
