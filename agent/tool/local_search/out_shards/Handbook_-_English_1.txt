This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
In the English minor, you will acquire understanding of the written and spoken word as tools of communication, creative world-building and critical reflection. The English minor equips you with the skills to analyse and enjoy works of literature from a range of periods and traditions and to situate these works in their social, political and cultural contexts.
Our world-class academic staff will introduce you to a range of theoretical perspectives that can be applied to the study of global literatures in English and that will help you formulate your own arguments about the uses and meanings of literary texts. You will examine literature as a transformative force in the contemporary world, and explore the development of literary forms over time and within different locations and cultures. You will research the complex relationship between literatures and worlds and between writers and their works. You will hone your skills of oral and written communication, learning to construct arguments, defend a point of view and engage in a collaborative process of active knowledge production.
