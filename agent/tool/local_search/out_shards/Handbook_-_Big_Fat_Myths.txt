Weight loss fads in the form of diets and exercise regimes (with mostly unrealistic claims) are ubiquitous in modern day life; however, there is surprising ignorance and confusion about how we lose weight, with most people unable to answer the simplest question: when one loses weight, where does the fat go?
This course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom one eats into and out of the body while investigating the fate of fat during weight loss. There will be a focus on how humans convert food into useful energy, why energy is important, what exactly happens in the body during weight loss and weight gain, and how one can change their lifestyle in subtle ways to live a healthier life.
The course is delivered fully online with asynchronous lectures and a compulsory weekly 2-hour synchronous tutorial. It is aimed at all students who have an interest in learning about the science of diet and exercise. No prior scientific knowledge is needed as the content is delivered for a general audience.
