This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The Visual Arts specialisation in the Bachelor of Fine Arts is designed for students wanting to explore and develop their art practice in a supportive and engaged artistic community. With a focus on studio-based learning that is underpinned by specialist workshops, facilities, and equipment, you will be supported to experiment with a range of artistic media, techniques, and processes as you develop your individual practice. Whether through Drawing, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Moving Image, or interdisciplinary artforms, as a Visual Arts student you will be encouraged to challenge yourself as you explore the ideas and questions that are important and meaningful to you. As part of an active and peer-oriented studio environment, you will receive regular focused feedback on your art practice and contribute to critical discussions about art and its intersections with a range of historical, cultural, social, political, and theoretical contexts. Professional practice skills and pathways are also embedded throughout, giving you the means to chart your future as an artist and creative professional.
