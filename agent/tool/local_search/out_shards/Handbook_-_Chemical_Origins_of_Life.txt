Scientific understanding of the origin of life is undergoing rapid evolution, involving collaborations amongst many scientific disciplines wherein chemistry plays the central role. This course is designed for non-Chemistry majors who want to learn some broadly relevant chemistry beyond first year. It is also an allowed elective for Chemistry majors. The course will examine how important biomolecules central to life as we know it, like sugars, amino acids, nucleotides and polymers thereof, could have been synthesised abiotically and come together to form the first primitive cells. Topics will include: 1) synthesis and observation of molecules in astrochemical and terrestrial environments, 2) discovering the role of important biomolecules like, DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, and 3) understanding scientific progress towards making synthetic protocells in the lab. To achieve this, three modules are presented that give students a framework to build on top of their knowledge learned in first year chemistry. The course will explore the chemistry able to be observed directly in space and in meteorites, cover some of the early chemical reactions that likely took place on the ancient Earth, explain the RNA world hypothesis and discuss the chemistry needed to make our own primitive cells (“protocells”) experimentally. Students will learn valuable concepts across a variety of chemistry-related subjects in service of gaining an understanding of the current scientific consensuses regarding the chemistry critical to life’s origins and what questions remain unanswered. The course will consist of weekly lectures, tutorials and workshops (no labs). Attendance at workshops is required.
