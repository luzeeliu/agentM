This is a Level 5 postgraduate course designed to deepen students' awareness and knowledge of IS/IT security-related issues within the dynamic realm of cyberspace. It places a specific emphasis on the imperative need for ethical viewpoints, approaches, and responsible practices from a management perspective when addressing the multifaceted challenges and solutions inherent in IS/IT-related security problems.
The course explores the symbiotic relationship between human and technical influences in cybersecurity, delves into risk management and breach mitigation strategies, provides insights into data governance and management frameworks, and identifies emerging trends and influences that will shape the future of cybersecurity and data governance. Through real-world business cases and scenarios, students will analyse the implications these issues present to various stakeholders and develop the skills needed to responsibly manage cyber-related security challenges.
