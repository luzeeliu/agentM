This course will give students an in-depth understanding of Australian defence policy across past, present and future contexts. It examines the fundamental concepts that have underpinned Australian defence policy: how and why Australian defence policy has evolved; and the options available for resolving current and prospective dilemmas. Students will study the balance between defence of Australia tasks and broader security commitments; the tools for producing sustainable capacity (personnel, equipment and national support); and the complexities of managing security relations with others. The course will therefore equip students working in Defence or related areas with the knowledge and skills to contribute to the development of policy.
