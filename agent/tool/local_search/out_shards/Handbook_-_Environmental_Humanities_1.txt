This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Species extinction, genetically modified organisms, climate change and nuclear power are just a few of the challenges facing us today. While these are all clearly 'environmental' issues, they are also all profoundly social, cultural and political challenges. Education in the Environmental Humanities focuses on developing critical insight into the 'human dimensions' of these environmental issues; issues that now permeate almost every aspect of our lives, from everyday lifestyle decisions to collective and public choices concerning urban development, energy security and food production.
Environmental Humanities is an interdisciplinary major specialisation that is designed to provide you with a deep understanding with which to critically engage with contemporary environmental issues. Drawing on resources from across the humanities and social sciences, teaching in Environmental Humanities provides you with a valuable and distinctive approach to the environment, grounded in the fields of history, philosophy, geography, cultural studies, literature, science and technology studies (STS) and social theory.
Your final course in the Environmental Humanities major will engage in a substantial research project focusing on a contemporary environmental issue.
