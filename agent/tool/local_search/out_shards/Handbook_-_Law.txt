Please note: This Program is not available for enrolment. The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) cannot be studied as a single stand alone degree.
The LLB must be studied with another degree. The information on this page outlines the academic requirements for completion of the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) when taken as an undergraduate double degree at UNSW.
The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) is an undergraduate law degree that is recognised as satisfying the academic requirements for admission as a legal practitioner in NSW. The degree is only offered in combination with another approved undergraduate degree (double degree award mode).
The discipline-specific (depth) component of the LLB consists of 144 Units of Credit (UOC) of Law courses comprising compulsory core courses, a prescribed theory elective and Law electives as set out below.
The breadth component of the program is achieved by satisfactory completion of the second program undertaken in the double degree award mode. Undergraduate double degree LLB students are not required to do General Education courses.
Students cannot transfer from a double degree enrolment to single degree enrolment in the LLB. Transfer from concurrent double degree enrolment to the single enrolment in the non-Law program may be available, subject to the rules of that program.
