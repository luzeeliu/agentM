Sophisticated modelling techniques are essential for the analysis of real-world health data. Building on Health Data Analytics: Statistical Modelling I (HDAT9600), this course expands the statistical toolkit and broadens your understanding of relevant statistical approaches for the analysis of realistically complex data structures and research questions. The course is aimed at those currently working or planning on working in health or a health-related field, and who are interested in applying advanced statistical methods to analyse complex data.
Topics covered in this course include multilevel models for hierarchical data; analysis of time series and longitudinal data; causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and quasi-experimental approaches to inform causal analysis of observational data; and multiple imputation for missing values.
Content is delivered through a combination of online readings, expert guest lectures and practical hands-on tutorials. Statistical concepts are illustrated with a variety of health examples, and you will learn how to implement methods using leading statistical software.
