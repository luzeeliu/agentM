How can we design complex chemical product formulations that are effective, more sustainable, and safe? How can the formulations be adapted to varying regulatory requirements, environmental conditions, and consumer preferences to shape the face of the industry? In this course, you will explore the principles and techniques behind developing the chemical products that are essential to modern life, such as paints, food, agrochemicals, and consumer and healthcare goods. This course provides an understanding of the chemical, physical, and engineering concepts required to design and optimise formulations that meet specific functional, safety, and sustainability requirements in today’s rapidly changing world.
You will engage with real-world challenges, such as enhancing the durability of coatings, improving the efficiency of agrochemicals, or ensuring the stability and safety of food and cosmetic products. As you explore these areas, the course will emphasise the importance of the circular economy, encouraging you to innovate with a strong awareness of environmental and social constraints. By the end, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to pursue a career in industries where formulation science is key to addressing the global need for sustainable and socially responsible product development.
