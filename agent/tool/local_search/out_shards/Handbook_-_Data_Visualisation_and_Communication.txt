How can data help you tell a story? How can you use data storytelling to then tackle some of the big challenges we are facing around the world?
Data visualisation and communication are critical skills in many professions. The creation of targeted, easily digestible visuals allows us to make sense of complex information in an accessible and easily understandable way. The ability to employ visuals will enhance almost any presentation to better engage our audience, make our messages more memorable, and facilitate more effective decision-making.
In this course, we will give you the tools to create your own data story addressing a pressing and current global challenge as identified by the UN SDGs. You will learn how to design your story for your chosen audience, how to criticise misrepresentations of data (especially the intentional ones), and drive action to address your chosen challenge.
So, how will you leave the world a better place?
