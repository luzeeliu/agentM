This course provides students with an opportunity to conduct a series of advanced experimental investigations in a range of areas, including: Electronics; Electromagnetism; Laser and Spectroscopy; Optics and Photonics; Quantum, Atomic and Nuclear Physics; Solid State Physics; and Nanotechnology. Experiments consist of a series of self-directed exercises that make use of specific sets of instruments/apparatus, and are run over a number of weekly four-hour laboratory sessions within the Higher Year Teaching Laboratory. In addition to the standard laboratory experiments, students will conduct a take-home project throughout the term focused on chaotic/complex dynamics. The project work is supported by a weekly lecture, which introduces the concepts and techniques necessary to complete the project. Laboratory and project work is assessed through a written report together with a 20-minute oral interview with the academic coordinator.
