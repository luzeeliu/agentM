This course introduces psychology as a biological science. The emphasis is on understanding the links between the neurobiology of the brain, sensory organs and nervous system and human behaviour. The lecturers on this course will provide students with diverse perspectives on psychology from various experimental traditions and levels of analysis – behavioural, cognitive and neurophysiological. Topics covered in lectures and tutorials on this course include cognitive psychology, animal learning, psychobiology, perception, and abnormal psychology. Through interactive tutorials, group presentations, research participation and a written essay, the aim of the course is to develop fundamental skills in finding, evaluating, generating, and integrating psychological research evidence. There is no assumed knowledge, and the course is suitable for any UNSW undergraduate with an interest in experimental psychology, cognitive science, clinical psychology and neuroscience.
