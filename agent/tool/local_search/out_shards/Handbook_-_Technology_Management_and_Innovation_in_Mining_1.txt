Through this course, you will gain an overview of various mining operations and the core technologies involved, explore historical and recent trends in mining technology development, and understand the dynamic management requirements associated with evolving technologies -particularly in diverse resource and economic contexts. You will also have the opportunity to identify innovative and potentially transformative technologies and mining systems.
You will work both individually and in small groups to explore how your chosen innovations and/or new technologies fit within a mining industry application and then evaluate your ideas through structured technology audits, risk assessments, implementation plans, capital justification and possible commercialisation opportunities for the technology – for both the Australian and/or international mining industries.
