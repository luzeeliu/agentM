Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is a course for postgraduate students in the School of Art & Design that provides opportunities to gain practical, hands-on experience by undertaking a professional placement aligned with your studies and career aspirations. After first sourcing and negotiating a placement, you will undertake your approved placement (typically 100 hours) with a focus on applying your skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of your host organisation or mentor. The placement is designed to bridge your academic studies with the next stages of your professional career, and as such, should be taken later in your program. Placement opportunities can be either self-sourced or advertised by the School. Please contact the Faculty WIL Unit for further details: ada-wil@unsw.edu.au
