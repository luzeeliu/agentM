Social innovation can be developed in almost any context. It is often a response to an identified problem, issue or opportunity. One of the most challenging aspects of developing and delivering social innovation is identifying the essence of what needs to be addressed, as the problems can be wicked in nature. Design thinking, methods and practices offer a broad set of tools that facilitate a multi-disciplinary to transdisciplinary approach to solving problems and innovating, taking a whole systems (rather than a silo) approach to offer different perspectives to traditional business tools and problem solving. Design for Social Innovation offers participants the opportunity to learn and apply design tools and methods to real projects.
Design for Social Innovation is an elective subject for the Graduate Certificate in Social Impact and other post-experience programs. It provides an overview and introduction to the role and application of design methods in social innovation and social enterprise. This course will provide the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and apply design thinking principles at a project or organisational level.
