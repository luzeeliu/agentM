The 3980 Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) program is a 144 UOC undergraduate program offered by UNSW Aviation through the Faculty of Science and resides within a suite of undergraduate aviation programs under UNSW Aviation, including the Bachelor of Aviation (Management) and the Bachelor of Aviation (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems).
This program gives students the opportunity to explore the science behind aviation, earn their flying licences and get ready to take on global opportunities within the aviation sector. The program not only educates and trains pilots to the highest commercial standards, but also develops future industry leaders and managers.
The aim of this program is to prepare students for a successful piloting career in aviation as well as future industry leaders and managers both domestically and globally.
The program focuses on skills and knowledge needed to become a professional pilot working either as a single pilot in a general aviation organisation, or as a multi-crew team in an airline. The Flying program includes flight training to a minimum level of Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), Instrument Rating - Multi Engine Aeroplane and Air Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) theory subjects, which are directly managed and delivered through the UNSW Aviation Flying Operations Unit at Bankstown Airport. Students can enhance their aviation skills further with electives that include Instructor Rating and aviation research.
Aviation management areas include Human Factors and Safety, Airworthiness Management, Commercial Operations, Resource Management, Airline Management and Aviation Economics. Students also have the opportunity to develop research, critical thinking and analysis skills that underpin the program and enable them to be industry ready and confidently approach challenges in aviation.
The program has been designed by UNSW Academics and key aviation industry partners and provides students with an opportunity to gain real-world experience, which includes being directly mentored by professional pilots in the industry. In addition, Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) students also have the opportunity to kickstart their flying careers through optional involvement in the Qantas - Aviation Career Enrichment Program (Q-ACE). Q-ACE is designed by Qantas to support students at UNSW to develop professional skills and behaviours by presentations delivered during second year. After completion of Q-ACE, students are provided a pathway at Qantas recruiting to update their aviation experience for employment consideration.
The program involves a minimum of 3 years of full-time study. The rules and requirements of the degree are set out below.
*Note: Due to the block training nature of the flight training program, teaching periods might not correspond to standard academic sessions, and students will need to undertake the Professional Pilot Program (flying training) on a full-time basis.

Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
For Faculty of Science policies on Recognition of Prior Learning, see https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/student-life-resources/student-resources/faculty-science-rules.
For recognition of previous flying experience, the following procedures apply.
In order for aeronautical experience gained during previous training to be used as aeronautical experience for the grant of a Commercial Pilot Licence at UNSW, these conditions must be satisfied:
UNSW must have a copy of the training records made by the previous training provider – we will ask for your authority to transfer your records from your previous training provider
The training must have been conducted under Part 142 of the
Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998
(
an integrated course
) – the previous training provider will confirm this is the case
If the previous training was as part of an integrated course, then based on the records provided UNSW's Head of Operations will determine what part of our integrated course requires completion, so that taken together the courses meet the requirements and standards specified in the legislation.
If the training was not part of an integrated course, then none of the existing aeronautical experience can be used to satisfy the legislated aeronautical experience requirements for the issue of a Commercial Licence following an integrated course like at UNSW.
Special Admission Requirements
Expand all
External test
keyboard_arrow_down
Job-Focused Assessment - an online psychometric behavioural and cognitive test that allows UNSW to select applicants with the most appropriate abilities and professional behaviours required for new pilots to be successful in their flying training and professional careers.
Applicants must complete the assessment before applying for admission via UAC (domestic students) or UNSW Apply Online (international students).

Participation and Enrolment Requirements

Criminal records check
keyboard_arrow_down
Students must apply for and obtain an Australian Security Identification Card that includes an Aviation Security Status Check under Aviation Transport Security Regulations. The application will be facilitated by the School of Aviation in first year.
Medical assessment
keyboard_arrow_down
Students should hold a class 1 aviation medical certificate before accepting an offer of enrolment. If students accept an offer of enrolment without having first holding class 1 aviation medical certification, UNSW will not be responsible for any delay, disruption, or inability to commence or continue flying training due to a medical certification problem.
At least class 2 aviation medical certification is required for the flying training after enrolment, except the Commercial Pilot Licence flight test requires the student to hold class 1 aviation medical certification.
Other
keyboard_arrow_down
This program includes practical flying training for the award of an Australian Commercial Pilot Licence and Instrument Rating. UNSW holds authorisations granted under civil aviation legislation to conduct flying training. Students must complete flying training in accordance with the Operations Manual approved by the regulator, and the Professional Pilot Program Procedures Manual, which includes the administrative procedures and rules applicable to the practical flying component.
Students must pass an aviation English language proficiency assessment conducted by the Head of Operations (or delegate) to participate in the flying training component of the program. Documentary evidence of standardised English tests, prior study in English, or other proof allowed by the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations must be provided. The assessment will be facilitated by the School of Aviation in first year.
Internship, Placement and Exchange Opportunities
Students have an opportunity to utilise 6 UOC of electives in a work placement through the UNSW Work Integrated Learning (WIL) program. The WIL program allows students to gain real-world aviation industry experience and foster networks and connections with industry partners. Exchange opportunities are available, though these are not a requirement for completion of the program. Credit for exchange subjects may be submitted for consideration for approval.
Progression Requirements
Continued participation requirements: In order to commence flying training after enrolment, students must:
Obtain an Australian Aviation Reference Number issued by CASA;
Obtain a CASA Class 1 Aviation Medical Certificate. UNSW recommends the Class 1 medical is obtained as early as possible, preferably before an offer of enrolment is accepted;
Submit sufficient identity documentation and other personal information to apply for an Aviation Security Identity Card and qualify for the Card after the security checks;
Pass Flight Selection.
Students must pass Flight Selection to begin flying training. Flight selection occurs during and immediately after term 3 of first year, and includes Basic Aeronautical Knowledge theory (AVIA 1111); five hours of airborne and simulated flying training; an assessment of English language proficiency (mandated by legislation) and pilot aptitude testing.
Students must pass Flight Selection (including AVIA 1111) to enter core second year flying courses and also have performed satisfactorily in flying training. Students must pass the core second year flying courses to remain in the program and proceed to core third year flying courses, and also to have performed satisfactorily in flying training.
