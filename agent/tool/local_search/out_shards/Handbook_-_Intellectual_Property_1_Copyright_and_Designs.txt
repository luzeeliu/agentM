This course, together with
Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents,
collectively consider Australian intellectual property (IP) law.
IP—which encompasses the laws of copyright, designs, patents, breach of confidence, passing off and registered trade marks, as well as various related doctrines—has become one of the most important areas of commercial legal practice in recent years. It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.
Intellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs considers two key aspects of Australian IP law. The first, which is the focus of the course, is the law of copyright. Copyright primarily protects creative and entrepreneurial subject matter such as books, art, music, films and TV broadcasts. The course focuses on key issues such as the history of and justifications for copyright; copyright subject matter; requirements for subsistence; ownership and exploitation; infringement, defences and remedies; and moral rights. Attention will also be paid to emerging debates, policy issues and law reform proposals on such issues as the impact of digital technology, rights in entertainment franchises and indigenous artists’ rights. The second aspect of IP law considered in the course is registered designs, with a focus on requirements for registration, infringement, and the techniques used to manage the overlap between copyright and design protection.
Intellectual  Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.
