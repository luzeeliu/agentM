Can you imagine your life without electricity, computers or mobile phones? Circuits are all around us. Electrical engineers are most commonly associated with the development of circuits, but they are not the only ones who know about or work with circuits. All engineers need to have a basic understanding of the relationship between electricity, electrical energy, electronic instrumentation, and measurements. Mechanical engineers use circuits, for example, when designing motors or controls for spacecrafts. Robotics is closely related to Computer Science, but it is hard to imagine doing anything in robotics without considerable knowledge of electrical circuits.
ELEC1111 is an introductory course in Electrical Engineering. It provides an introduction to fundamental analogue electrical elements such as sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors and diodes, as well as fundamental circuit analysis techniques, including Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, nodal and mesh analysis and circuit theorems (superposition, source transformation, Thévenin & Norton equivalents). It then expands to fundamental analogue circuits including resistor-capacitor (RC) and resistor-inductor (RL) circuits and operational amplifiers, and AC analysis concepts, including phasors, impedances and AC power.
