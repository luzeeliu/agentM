Course Sharing for Double Specialisations
keyboard_arrow_down
Students who complete two specialisations that share a common Foundation Core Course (COMMKS and ECONFS, FINSCS and FINSQS, or MARKGS and MARKTS) must take an additional 6 UOC of Electives or Capstone Courses. These students are strongly recommended to choose another specialisation course as their additional Elective.
For example, in Finance and Financial Technology where FINS5512 are requirements for both specialisations, students are recommended to complete an additional specialisation core elective course – e.g. FINS5510/FINS5530 or FINS5545/FINS5546/FINS5547/FINS5548/FINS5557.
