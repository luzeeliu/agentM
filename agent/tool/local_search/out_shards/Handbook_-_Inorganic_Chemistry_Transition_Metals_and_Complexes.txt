This course provides insight into the current state-of-art research where metals are used in technologies such as semiconductors, batteries, solar cells, superconductors, and where metals are used in life such as photochemical processes, nitrogen fixation. This course showcases the importance of understanding the role of the metal in these systems. The key components of structural characterization relevant to this understanding are covered and the function derived from the structure expanded. The way chemistry can be used to tune structure and hence properties is shown to underpin all of these technologies and processes in life.
Students will engage in a series of flipped classes; lecture material is pre-recorded with follow up in person workshops each week. The laboratory activities link to the lecture content and also expand upon it.
This course is suitable for those seeking either a career in science/chemistry or who wish to develop their critical thinking and/or problem-solving skills.
