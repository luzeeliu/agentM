This course traces the key practices, themes, and approaches that have shaped contemporary media arts practice. You are encouraged to engage with a wide range of media arts practitioners since the 1960s so that you can situate contemporary practices within a diverse range of histories, theories, and interdisciplinary strategies. The course examines Australian and international media arts practices with a particular focus on the historical lineages that inform current trends in the field. Due to the emergent nature of the work and themes discussed, these debates are often open and developing, enabling you to investigate the area in an active and engaged manner. The course also supports you to develop foundational skills such as visual analysis, academic writing, and referencing, which will underpin your future studies in this area.
