Research is the agent for generating new knowledge about our world, creating the basis for new innovations, and transforming professional practice. Today, research in the School of Chemical Engineering is transforming how we feed the world, treat disease, produce resources, develop new products and power our economy. In Research Thesis C you will conclude this experience of research in the School and/or industrial research and development.
This is the third course of the three course Research Thesis sequence. In these inquiry-based learning courses, you will integrate your discipline knowledge and skills learned through academic study and professional experience. In Research Thesis C, you will complete your project work and communicate your findings in written and oral forms. You will be assisted in this process by your supervisor.
Throughout Research Thesis you will apply your advanced cognitive and technical skills to innovatively solve problems and/or generate knowledge in chemical engineering, food science and related disciplines. The project you undertake will address a complex, open-ended problem that allows room for the creative, critical and reflective acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. At the outset, there will be multiple possible solutions to or interpretations of, and the problem will be sufficiently complex that you will need to carefully design and manage the project to reach a successful conclusion.
Subject to making good progress in CEIC4951 and with the approval of your supervisor, you may be permitted to enroll in CEIC4952 at the same time as this course.
