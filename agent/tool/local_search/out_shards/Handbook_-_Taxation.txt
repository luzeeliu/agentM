NOTE: For Commerce/Law students. Courses listed in the Taxation Major of the BCom (other than TABL2710 and TABL2741) may be counted to the Commerce component of the degree. No other TABL courses may be counted to the degree.
Taxation funds the provision of government services, is a tool in economic management and is an important consideration in all business decisions. Indeed in a modern business environment no decision can be responsibly made without consideration being given to tax implications.
Taxation affects every aspect of commercial life from the choice of business vehicle, to the financing of business operations, to the offshore expansion of a business, to the retirement plans for employees.
Managers, accountants, auditors, financial officers and those working in banking, insurance, international business and government policy development and commerce generally require knowledge of business taxation. Tax consultants assist clients in structuring business transactions in tax effective ways. Tax consultants are highly sought after and are involved in creative, challenging and rewarding work.
