Introducing Law and Justice is the first of the foundational level core courses for the LLB degree. This course introduces students to the history, operation and contemporary dynamics of our legal system. It provides a grounding in the core legal skills necessary for successful study and practice, including legal research and writing; case analysis and critique; and the interpretation and application of statutes. All of these skills will continue to be developed through your LLB studies.
All classes in Introducing Law and Justice are small, with a focus on interactive teaching.
All students enrolled in Introducing Law and Justice will also enrol in the co-requisite course, Legal Research and Writing, LAWS1055, which introduces foundational legal writing and research skills, such as legal citation, location of primary and secondary materials and various forms of legal writing and argument, including a case note and legal essay.
Students will attend classes for Introducing Law and Justice as well as classes for Legal Research and Writing.
The skills and knowledge taught in Legal Research and Writing are foundational to the skills and knowledge covered and assessed in Introducing Law and Justice.
