The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree is offered in all faculties of the University of New South Wales and encourages initiative and originality in research. Candidates should make a significant contribution to knowledge in their field.
This program involves a minimum of three years full-time study. Students undertake supervised research leading to the production of a thesis, which may include studio research.
The length of a doctoral thesis normally should not exceed 100,000 words of text and may be signifcantly less in cases where studio research forms part of the thesis. The thesis (including studio research, if applicable) must be submitted for examination within 4 years of full-time study.
