Major changes are reshaping how we finance solutions to social problems, from the role of investment, funding, and philanthropy, both internationally and in the Australian context: global economic realignments, the privatisation of community services; new patterns of wealth distribution and of inter-generational wealth transfer; greater expectations of the role of corporate citizenship and of corporate philanthropy. These forces are also encouraging the growth of new forms of 'social investment' and finance, in which commercial enterprise is being shaped by social as well as financial goals, to create innovative, and sometimes hybrid, models of sustainable community services, environmental protection and social development, as well as new business opportunities.
This course will introduce the history, core concepts and current issues in the fields of philanthropy, fundraising and social investment. It will also examine patterns of fundraising and giving, ethical and philosophical perspectives and the management and legal aspects of social investment programs.
