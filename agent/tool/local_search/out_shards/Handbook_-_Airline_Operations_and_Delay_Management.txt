This course focuses on introducing the key aspects of airline operations and delay management such as airline ground operations (including passenger facilitation and aircraft turnaround operations), delay data collection, delay data analysis, delay development modelling, airline networks, and the emerging concept of robust airline scheduling. The course is designed to provide students with practical airline operations knowledge coupled with the use of mathematical models in delay analysis, leading to the study of ways in which to improve the robustness of airline scheduling in actual operations. Hence, some units of this course may contain mathematical models that require extra effort in self-study. With ongoing academic guidance, virtual classroom discussions are provided to support the development of these skills. Basic statistical knowledge is ideal for this course. Students with airline operations experience may be able to grasp this course quickly; however, prior operations experience is not essential for studying this course.
