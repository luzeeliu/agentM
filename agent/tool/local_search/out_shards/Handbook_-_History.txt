This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
History is the study of humanity in all its dimensions. It explores the diversity of human experience, the richness of difference in ideas, culture and institutions. We look into many pasts to try to understand today's world, to recognize what we share and to measure how profoundly our lives today differ and why. The major specialisation in History will give you a deep understanding of social, cultural, intellectual, political and military history, and we teach and conduct research in histories of gender, ethnicity and religion in world history.
UNSW's History program is distinctive among Australian universities in pioneering Transnational history which concerns the circulation of peoples, ideas, technologies and institutions across national boundaries since the emergence of nation states as an important phenomenon in world history. History teaches clear thinking, analysis, written and oral communication skills. These attributes are the foundation of citizenship and ideal qualities for employment across a range of careers.
