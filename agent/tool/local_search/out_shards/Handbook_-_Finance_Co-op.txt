The finance co-op major stream provides outstanding scholars with the opportunity of undertaking their course work in the Bachelor of Commerce degree with industrial training experience. By combining their degree with hands-on practical experience, Co-op scholars are provided with an excellent opportunity for furthering their knowledge and skills in partnership with sponsor organisations. This stream gives scholars an opportunity to broaden their knowledge beyond finance by taking up another major i.e. double major instead of taking up compulsory honours subjects.
This stream can be completed within the four-year degree program which combines the requirements of the Bachelor of Commerce with 18 months of coordinated industry placement (Industry placement extends outside university semesters).
Note:
Finance Co-op students are required to maintain a Distinction Average to meet the program requirements.
