The Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering offer a dual degree program which qualifies students for two degrees after the equivalent of six years of successful full-time study leading to the award of the degrees Bachelor of Advanced Science(Honours) and Bachelor of Engineering (Honours).
The Faculty of Science administers the program, and delegates administration of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) requirements to the School which offers the Engineering discipline selected. Students should seek advice from the Faculty of Science regarding their Advanced Science (Honours) program, and the relevant Engineering School Office, or the Faculty of Engineering, regarding their Engineering program.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 288 UOC (after the 24 UOC reduction from double counted courses).
Bachelor of Advanced Science (Honours) (144 UOC)
1. Core Courses
2. An approved Bachelor of Science Major
3. Science Elective Courses
4. An Honours Specialisation
Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (168 UOC)
1. A 168 UOC Engineering stream consisting of the following:
At least 48 UOC Disciplinary Knowledge and Enquiry-based Courses
30-42 UOC Introductory Knowledge core courses
At least 12 UOC of elective courses
The balance of stream to consist of Foundation Disciplinary Knowledge Courses
2. Students must also complete at least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience.
In this dual degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons), and 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hons), for a total of 312 UOC. Because the Science courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the dual degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 288 UOC. Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Advanced Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 288 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 288 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.
In some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,
Students completing a Maths major should replace the upper level math course in Engineering as follows:
Civil Engineering: CVEN2002 or CVEN2702 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Mechatronic Engineering: MATH2089 - replace with MATH2301 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Electrical Engineering: MATH2069 - replace with MATH2011 and MATH2521 or higher versions, and MATH2099 -- replace with MATH2501 and MATH2801 or higher versions
Software Engineering: MATH2859 + MATH2400 - replace with (MATH2801 or MATH2901) and MATH3411
