Description
Examines marine pelagic and estuarine habitats and the practical application of theory to the ocean environment and its effect on the life of marine organisms. Emphasis is placed on the biology of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish, together with the study of fisheries. Also looks at management, marine technology, computer simulations, conservation, other marine vertebrates, aquaculture and environmental concerns, and technical skills, taxonomy and sampling design. Note: A field trip may be held during the mid-session break and personal costs may be incurred. Session 2Studies the ecology of marine and freshwater systems, emphasising benthic communities; population and community dynamics of these systems; evolution of life histories in the light of the constraints of aquatic systems. Emphasis is on experimental approaches to aquatic ecology. Special topics considered include chemical ecology, plant/herbivore ecology, and applied aspects of the topic such as mariculture, and there is a section on the biology and taxonomy of marine algae (seaweeds).
Note:
Fieldwork is an important component of the course and personal costs may be incurred.
