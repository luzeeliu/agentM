This course provides an advanced treatment of theoretical, physiological, and computational approaches in the study of visual perception. It follows on, and assumes knowledge, from PSYC2071 Perception and Cognition or a similar introductory coverage of perception. The general orientation of the course is a theoretical one but applied aspects such as the role of basic perceptual processes in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, and the implications for the design of effective visual displays will be discussed as well. In addition to weekly lectures, the laboratory classes are designed to allow opportunities for in-depth and active learning of research methods in perception and development of oral and written presentation skills. All lectures and tutorials encourage an interactive style; engaging with the  questions being asked and answered will  promote problem-solving, reflective, active and cooperative learning.
