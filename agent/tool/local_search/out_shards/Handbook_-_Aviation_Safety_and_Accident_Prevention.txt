Safety and accident prevention is an issue that encroaches upon practically every aspect of human endeavour; none more so than within the aviation industry.
With advancements in accident investigation research techniques, legislative initiatives and international co-operation increasing, this area of the aviation industry has contributed enormously to the very high levels of aviation safety throughout the world. As the commercial aviation sector continues to evolve, as does its safety challenges, agility and integrity of all organisational safety systems will be key to managing these safety issues in the new operating environment.
This fully online, distance education course provides an overview of the safety system of civil aviation and of the cause of organisational accidents within such complex systems through case study-based learning. The course will explore topics including human factors, crew resource management, air safety investigation, safety management, accident causation, safety regulatory authorities, and the future of safety. Assessments will provide students with an opportunity to test their understanding of concepts throughout the course and align theory with real world applications.
