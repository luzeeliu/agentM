Ceramic materials are essential to a wide range of technological/societal applications including building and civil construction, energy storage and conversion, computing and electronics, and health and biomedicine. Successful use of ceramics in these areas is critically dependent on the composition and (micro)structure of the materials which, in turn, are determined by the processing used to manufacture them. As a Materials Engineer/Scientist, you are the expert responsible for the manufacturing of ceramic products and in this course you will learn the phenomenological material behaviour that underpins ceramic manufacturing and combine this with the actual engineering technology to design ceramic manufacturing processes for specific products and devices that are used throughout society, and analyse processing problems and prescribe evidence-based solutions.
This course is a Level 3 core course in the BE(Hons)(Materials Science and Engineering) program and in the Materials Science major of BSc and BAdvSci(Hons) programs, and is also suitable for science and engineering students who need a fundamental understanding of the fabrication of ceramic materials. The course is completed as weekly lectures, self-learning online activities, and in-person laboratory classes.
