Contemporary Issues in Indigenous Politics
examines contemporary debates in Australian Indigenous affairs, placing an emphasis on the political contexts within which these debates take place. Students will learn to analyse political debates in Indigenous affairs in terms of the history of state strategies to transform Indigenous populations and Indigenous peoples' strategies to retain control over their collective cultural, political and economic development. The course encourages students to consider the impact of powerful interests, ideology and political institutions in constraining and enabling political participation by Indigenous people and communities. It also explores different models of political representation and engagement in the context of contemporary debates around recognition, sovereignty and treaty.
