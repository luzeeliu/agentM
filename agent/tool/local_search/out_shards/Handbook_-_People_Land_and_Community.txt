Urbanisation is one of the most profound developments in human history.  The Industrial Revolution precipitated the mass movement of populations from rural to urban areas, presenting governments and communities with the challenge of fitting large numbers of people on limited land without compromising safety, health and happiness.
This course will look at urbanisation as a global, national and local phenomenon.  We will range from Mumbai slums to Hong Kong towers, recycled waterfronts to eco-communes.  We will explore the development of Sydney and its planned trajectory, studying significant urban regeneration sites like Ultimo and Pyrmont, as well as Greenfields developments on the urban fringe. We will consider the advantages and disadvantages of high density urban living vs low density suburban life. We will examine the role of private property law, particularly strata and community title, in constructing the built environment and then managing the people and communities who live there.  For example, should private property law be used not only to mandate what people build on their own land, but how they behave or even dress? Can "community" be created in new housing developments or must it develop organically? Should large tracts of bushland or waterfronts, roads, parks or sewerage treatment facilities be privatised or should they remain public assets? We will look at groups of people who have opted out of the city, setting up alternative communes or "utopias" in rural areas with community title legislation.  What is the motivation for these communities and do they work? Students will be introduced to sociological, legal and planning research, as well as studying the real-world application of those theories.  Topics include urban planning; Sydney city and its suburbs; large-scale commercial and residential high rise; master planned, eco and gated communities; child-friendly cities; metropolises of Asia; and urban regeneration.  This course will interest students who like big ideas, and want to explore the social, political, historical, economic and environmental theories that relate to law, land and the people who use them.
