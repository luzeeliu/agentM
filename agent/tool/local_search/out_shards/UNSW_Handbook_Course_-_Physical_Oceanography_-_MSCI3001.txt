Description
The way water circulates around the oceans has direct impacts on climate as well as marine ecology. In this course, we will dive into the way the ocean works. From the East Australian Current to the global conveyor belt, and from eddies to beach waves. We will cover the dynamics and properties of ocean water and the way those are measured, and apply it to problems like El Nino, the great garbage patches and Global Warming.
