This program (LLB (Honours)) is not available for enrolment. It cannot be studied as a single stand alone degree.
This program is for LLB students who commenced their LLB studies
in or after 2015
who wish to graduate with an LLB (Honours) degree.
Admission into the
LLB (Honours) programs
is via the Faculty of Law and Justice.
The LLB (Honours) is for high-achieving LLB students. While most of the requirements are identical to the LLB, what distinguishes the LLB (Honours) program is the requirement to undertake a mandatory, independent research project. Like the LLB, it must be undertaken as part of a double degree.

Application to LLB (Honours) program
UNSW LLB students are eligible to transfer to the LLB (Honours) program if, at the time of making their application, they:
1.	have successfully completed a minimum of 96 UOC of LLB courses;
2.	have successfully completed at least 84 UOC of core LLB courses (which can include the prescribed elective);
3.	have a minimum of 6 UOC of LLB courses still to complete at UNSW; and
4.	have a WAM in their core LLB courses (including the prescribed elective, if applicable) of 75 or above.

Honours requirements
LLB (Honours) students must complete a supervised 6 UoC course LAWS3901 Honours Research Thesis. The research thesis will be of 10,000 words. It will be double marked. As part of the Honours Research Thesis course, students need to complete a mandatory Research Methods and Skills Workshop. The workshop will equip the students with the skills necessary to become researchers and successfully complete their thesis. The supervisor of the student with the approval of the Honours and Legal Research and Writing Coordinator may exempt the student from completing the workshop if the supervisor believes that the student has the necessary skills to conduct the required research or there are other exceptional grounds for excusing the student.
All remaining courses that an LLB (Honours) student needs to complete their 144 UOC of study are to be taken from the core and prescribed theory elective courses required to be completed as part of the LLB program (if these have not already been completed), and from the list of law elective courses available to LLB students.
Medallist Requirements
The recommended student for the University Medal is expected to have maintained Good Standing throughout their UG career (ie, while undertaking their LLB and LLB (Honours)) and usually rank the highest amongst their graduating LLB (Honours) cohort. In addition to that, the recommended Medallist will be compared in different categories with other students attaining the LLB (Honours) (Class 1) to identify the best/top student based on each category.
These categories of comparison include:
•	Honours WAM
•	WAM for all LAWS courses
•	WAM for LAWS core courses and LAWS prescribed elective
•	WAM for LAWS elective courses
•	WAM for best 4 LAWS elective courses
•	WAM for best 19 LAWS courses
•	WAM for all LAWS courses minus two lowest marks
