Subject areas: Social Research & Policy
This course can also be studied in the following specialisations: Criminology and Social Work
This course explores the nature of the applied social sciences and provides information about how social science can be applied to real world problems. You will be introduced to ideas about the role and use of evidence in decision-making and policy-making at local, national and international levels. We also investigate how policy is developed, changed, implemented and evaluated in applied social science domains such as social policy, public policy, criminal justice and social work. We will also discuss the practical, political and ethical problems encountered in the communication of research and expertise to inform policy and social change.
The course introduces students to key ideas, debates and issues within the social sciences in relationship to policy and practice. We develop key strategies and skills that students can apply to particular areas of employment in the key areas of public and social policy, social work and criminal justice. A series of real-world policy case studies highlighting current research will be used to illustrate the connections between policy, practice and current debates.
