This is your first course in Engineering Mechanics, which is the study of the interaction of matter and forces in engineering contexts. It is evident that all objects in the world around us are composed of matter, and they are all subject to forces. As such, Engineering Mechanics is the foundational tool for engineers, and forms the underlying basis for understanding more advanced fields such as Solid Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Rigid Body Dynamics, Aerodynamics, Structures, Control and many aspects of Advanced Design.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
