Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning - especially in deep learning methods - are creating products and services with the potential to change the insurance industry and actuarial work. This course will introduce students to concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI), with particular focus on deep learning models, and their applications to actuarial work.  A particular focus of the course will be on how those AI models can be combined with other actuarial techniques in order to solve business problems in insurance and risk management including pricing, reserving and capital management, and insurance business processes. Students will be expected to understand the theory behind the models considered and their relationship to other actuarial techniques, and to fit and evaluate various deep learning models using appropriate software.
