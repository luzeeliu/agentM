Large-scale electricity supply networks deliver electricity from the generating sources (e.g., power stations, wind farms, solar farms) to major load centres (e.g., cities, regional areas, heavy industry). This bulk transport of electricity must be carried out at high voltage to reduce power loss.  Thus, high voltage technology is an indispensable specialisation in power engineering. Knowledge in this area is essential for designers and operators of high-voltage equipment and power utility engineers.
This course provides detailed coverage of the common features of major items of high voltage equipment and components, including materials used and dielectric properties; field analysis and its use in determining the electrical insulation design; thermal ratings of equipment; the design of both static and dynamic contact systems for equipment; the design and operation of specific items of equipment including power and instrument transformers, switchgear, cables, overhead lines, surge arresters; techniques to generate and measure high voltages; condition monitoring and high-voltage diagnostic testing methods.
