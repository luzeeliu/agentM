How would you feel if you were offered a course that would test your limits on how good you have become as a prospective electrical engineer? What would you think of having a course in your resume that is acknowledged by Engineers Australia, the main engineering accreditation body in Australia, as a flagship course due to its rigorous and comprehensive set of assessments on electrical engineering design? How does it feel to work on an industry-type project in a team while demonstrating your individual analytical knowledge and practical alongside soft skills required in modern high-tech industries? ELEC4123 is the course that will give you the competency and confidence you need to graduate as an electrical/telecommunications/quantum engineer who is job-ready and prepared to face real-world design challenges.
The course involves three core design competency components in the fields of Electronics, Control Systems, and Signal Processing. The elective component of the course provides an opportunity to apply your group work skills in a much broader scope on multidisciplinary industry-type projects with a focus on a mix of core topics mentioned above in a more advanced level, as well as other electrical engineering disciplines such as Power and Energy Systems, Network and Physical Communications, and Quantum Engineering. The topics also cover system safety and protection aspects as integral design requirements, including over-voltage, short circuit, and thermal protection. This ensures that students not only comprehend these critical concepts but also effectively apply them in practice. The components in core and elective topics may vary depending on the resources available in each term.
