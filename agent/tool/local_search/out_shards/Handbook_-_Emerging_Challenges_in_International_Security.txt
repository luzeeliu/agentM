What do we mean by the 'new' security agenda? Are emerging threats to international security really 'new'? If so, how should security studies scholars analyse them, and what are the implications for security praxis? How are policymakers dealing with these emerging or 'new' security challenges, to what effect, and what are some of the alternatives? These are some of the key questions explored in this course, which investigates the broad and evolving agenda of security studies, and key themes and dynamics in contemporary security relations. Using a range of conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the course asks you to examine issues such as infectious disease, sexualized violence in armed conflict, migration and identity, food security, climate change, and nuclear proliferation, and question whether these constitute 'new' security challenges. It asks what the implications of such an approach are for security relations at the state-societal level; the scholarly field of security studies, and the practice of security in policymaking terms. You are required to have a good level of familiarity with key security theories and concepts. If you are new to the sub-discipline of Security Studies you will need to do additional background reading as advised in the course outline or by the course convenor.
