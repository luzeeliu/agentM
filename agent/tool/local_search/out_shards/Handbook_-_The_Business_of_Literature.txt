This course aims to orient you to the diversity of opportunities open to those who work in literary industries, including writers, publishers, and translators, with a focus on international texts and practices. It draws on a range of practical, theoretical, analytical and creative skills and approaches to examine the ways that literature and the literary are embedded in social, political, economic, and aesthetic realities in a range of global contexts. At its heart is a focus on the machinery of writing industries from Asia-Pacific to the Middle East and the Americas, which you will examine through a series of case studies and with the guidance of practitioners from fields such as publishing, translating, and editing. It will equip you to participate in a variety of careers in the field of the arts and humanities.
