This course examines contemporary topics and the complex interdependencies shaping global affairs, including global governance stakeholders, geopolitical tensions, and grand challenges. You will explore key areas of global interdependency such as the economy, environment, energy and resource politics, human mobility, security and territorial assertions. Through rich discussion, the course investigates how global stakeholders shape and negotiate these dynamics, and invites you to reflect on where you might position yourself within the international sphere. It also provides space for consolidating and reflecting upon learning across the degree and supports the development of professional skills relevant to a wide range of international career pathways.
