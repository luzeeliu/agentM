This course traces artistic responses to the urgencies of contemporary life. It focuses particularly on lineages and practices of activist art, including artistic forms of resistance, campaign, intervention, advocacy, and protest. With social practice, participatory art, and institutional critique key reference points, the course examines a variety of activist artists, collectives, exhibitions, and curatorial approaches, both inside and outside the cannon of art history. By examining diverse examples in relation to historical, theoretical, and ethical frameworks, the course provides opportunities to consider the complexities of how art meets its audience, how it interacts with publics and communities, and how art can drive change across social, cultural, political, and environmental contexts.
