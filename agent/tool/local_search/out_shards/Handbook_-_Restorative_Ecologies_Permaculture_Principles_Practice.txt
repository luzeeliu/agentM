This course will introduce foundational concepts of the ethics and principles of permaculture, a regenerative systems approach founded in Australia and global in impact. In this course, you will gain confidence in permaculture restorative frameworks and methodologies in the contexts of environmental management, leadership, and sustainability. Permaculture design seeks to reconnect people with ecological processes, inter-relationships, and interdependence of living things and to integrate these knowledges to tend to ecosystems in ways that care for the Earth, care for people, and use a fair share of resources. Permaculture has an important role to play in the rapid transition to zero carbon or net negative carbon through restorative and regenerative ecological, social, and cultural practices. The course will have a focus on implementing permaculture solutions, demonstrating how theory learned during seminars applies to real world systems.In successfully completing this course, you will develop applied skills to design and implement urban/suburban permaculture solutions. In addition, in earning an 80% or higher in the course, you will earn a Permaculture Design Certificate.
