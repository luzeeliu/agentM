This capstone course introduces the use of computational modelling in design and applications in material engineering. The principles and numerical methods of computer-aided design, computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis will be covered in lectures. The course emphasizes hands-on experience in using cutting-edge CAD (computer-aided design), CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and FEA (finite element analysis) software packages to solve real-world problems in materials engineering involving mechanical structures and fluid flow. The course includes lectures to introduce the principles and methods and computer lab sessions to build high-level modelling practices. Students are expected to have basic knowledge on mechanical properties of materials, fluid dynamics and heat transfer
