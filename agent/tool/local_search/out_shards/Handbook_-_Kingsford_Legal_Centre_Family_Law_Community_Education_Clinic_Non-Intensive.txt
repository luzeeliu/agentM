This clinic will develop a range of training modules for various community groups and community members focussing on family law and the cross over with domestic violence particularly focussing on children and the importance of their interests.
One of the units will involve a training workshop for Indigenous people at La Perouse, a local Aboriginal community, to be developed in conjunction with the Aboriginal Access worker at the Centre. Students will be responsible for preparing and presenting the workshops under the supervision of the Director and clinical supervisor and in conjunction with the Aboriginal access worker.
Other units will focus on providing training to rural and remote communities in conjunction with Women’s Legal Centre to ensure that women living in rural and remote communities are provided with accurate and relevant information about family law and domestic violence. Students will also participate in the normal running of the Centre including answering phone enquiries from members of the community, advice nights and making appropriate referrals.
