As the world transitions to renewable energy, there is a growing demand for reliable baseload power, an area where geothermal energy plays a vital role. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to geothermal engineering, bridging multiple disciplines including geology, thermodynamics, drilling technology, and reservoir (heat and mass transfer) simulation. In this course, students will develop a deep understanding of geothermal systems, covering key topics such as geological characterisation, heat and mass transfer, well drilling and completion, analytical and numerical reservoir modelling, as well as the environmental and economic assessments of geothermal development. In the final project student integrates these concepts in a real-life scenario, hence equipping students with both theoretical insight and practical skills necessary to analyse and design geothermal energy systems
