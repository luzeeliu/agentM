Mathematical tools are an important part of economic analysis. The main purpose of this course is to introduce you to
advanced mathematical techniques
used in theoretical and applied economic analysis. In addition, the course will provide a steppingstone to
Honours programs
in economics and related disciplines and to other advanced undergraduate courses.
This course gives you a working knowledge of basic analysis, topology, and static and dynamic optimisation techniques applied in economics. Topics include logic and set theory, topological principles in Euclidean spaces, properties of real-valued functions (continuity, concavity, quasi-concavity), differentiation in multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces, classical optimisation with and without constraints, comparative statics, and envelope theorems. Mathematical techniques are illustrated with mainstream theoretical applications such as consumer theory and game theory.
