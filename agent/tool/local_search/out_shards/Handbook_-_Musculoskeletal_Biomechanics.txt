Musculoskeletal biomechanics is an exciting and vital field that plays a key role in improving the quality of life for millions of people. At its heart, this discipline involves understanding how bones, muscles, and joints work together to support movement and withstand forces. One of the most impactful applications of musculoskeletal biomechanics is in the design and development of orthopedic replacements and prosthetics. These technologies are life-changing for individuals who have lost limbs or suffer from debilitating joint conditions like arthritis. By precisely engineering artificial joints and limbs that mimic the natural movement of the human body, biomechanics helps people regain mobility, reduce pain, and return to the activities they love. The advances in this field are not just about restoring function; they’re about giving people back their independence and enhancing their overall well-being, making it a truly inspiring area of study and innovation.
This course introduces you to the fundamental mechanics of the musculoskeletal system, focusing on how bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments collaborate to support movement and withstand forces. You will explore the kinematics and dynamics of human movement, learning how engineering concepts can be applied to understand joint mechanics, muscle function, and load distribution across the body. A strong emphasis is placed on real-world applications, particularly in the design and development of orthopedic replacements and prosthetics. Through this course, students will discover how biomechanical principles are used to engineer artificial joints that mimic natural movement, develop advanced prosthetic limbs, and create innovative treatments for musculoskeletal disorders.
This foundational course offers students a comprehensive understanding of the critical role biomechanics plays in restoring mobility, reducing pain, and improving overall well-being. By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the knowledge to further explore and innovate in the field of biomedical engineering.
