One of the defining developments in the international legal system over the past century has been the proliferation of international organisations. Today, hundreds of these institutions perform a diverse range of functions—from peacekeeping to fisheries management, from prosecuting international crimes to coordinating international postal services—and the regulatory impact of their work is felt in almost every aspect of our daily lives. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the law of international organisations, and the questions of legitimacy and accountability that they raise as a form of global governance. It will examine key principles of public international law relevant to the establishment, operation, and regulation of these institutions, including those concerning their legal personality and powers, membership and participation, immunities and privileges, international responsibility, and their law-making functions. It will also consider the relationship between these global governance bodies and domestic institutions. While the focus of the course is on international organisations generally, particular attention will also be given to the unique position of the United Nations in the international legal order, its role in international peace and security, and contemporary debates over its reform.
Main Topics
• The nature, legal personality, and powers of international organisations
• History and theory of international organisations and global governance
• Membership and participation in international organisations
• Immunities and privileges of international organisations
• The United Nations, peacekeeping, and international security
• Law-making by international organisations
• The responsibility and accountability of international organisations
• The relationship between international organisations and domestic legal systems
