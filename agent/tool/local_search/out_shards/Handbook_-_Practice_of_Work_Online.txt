CDEV3100 Practice of Work (Online) is an innovative, experiential course designed to enable students to integrate theory with the practice of work by working directly with a partner organisation (industry, community and government) on a real-world project. Students will learn about professional practice (including teamwork, project management, problem solving, design thinking, and communication skills) and develop their personal capabilities for lifelong learning and work. Students work in inter-disciplinary teams with WIL Central academics who assist in maximising learning and the quality of the project deliverables.
The course is available to domestic and international students and can be undertaken as a General Education course. For Business School students, it is an approved Non-Business WIL course.
The course is taught fully online with both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities. Depending on the location of students undertaking the course, synchronous workshops will be offered in two streams to accommodate two time zones, including AEST.
