This course provides students with solid conceptual knowledge and practical skills of both generic programming techniques and Python programming, to be used effectively in the many specialised courses that expect students to have acquired strong enough programming skills and well mastered the Python language. The features of the language are covered to a significant depth, and there is a strong emphasis on problem solving, from a broad base of application domains, with quite a few that involve mathematical notions. Like all foundation courses for postgraduate students, there is a lot of contents to study in limited time and the learning curve is not gentle. Still the course does not assume any prior knowledge of programming in general, or of Python programming in particular, as its content is self-contained for students with the expected mathematical background.
