A practical course that involves both advanced analysis and design of an engineered structure to solve a given problem. The course deals with behaviour of fundamental aspects of structural design, including advanced modelling. Students will work in groups to solve a specific problem; they will design and build their structure and then will then test it to destruction in the Heavy Structures and Materials Laboratories.
