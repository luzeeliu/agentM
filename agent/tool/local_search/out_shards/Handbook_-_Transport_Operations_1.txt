This course offers students an advanced understanding of the field of traffic engineering and congestion management, with a focus on traffic stream characteristics, stochasticity in transport systems and operations model to address congestion and delay minimisation. The course covers topics related to the analysis, design and evaluation of traffic congestion management systems including data collection and analysis methods, simulation techniques and stochastic process techniques used for traffic operations. Key topics include an introduction to traffic operations models, their application to traffic flow and multi-modal transport systems. Additionally, the course covers the operational characteristics of vehicles in multi-modal transport, including public transport, and the tools required to manage and analyze large volumes of real-world data. The focus is on applying traffic operation models and real-world data to effectively model and manage traffic flow.
