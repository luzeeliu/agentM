Physics
Description
Physics is the study of the laws of nature that govern the behaviour of the universe, from the very smallest scales of sub-atomic particles to the very largest in cosmology. It applies these laws to the solution of practical problems and to the development of new technologies.
Physicists engage a broad range of skills to undertake this work, and Physics is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, as physicists work with mathematicians, engineers, chemists and biologists in order to understand and solve a wide range of problems confronting society.
The study of Physics also helps develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. There are diverse areas of application of the laws of physics to areas such as astrophysics, biology, quantum computing, solid state physics and theoretical physics.
