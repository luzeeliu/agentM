This course introduces Engineering students to the field of Materials Science and Engineering. Throughout society, different materials are chosen for various applications. How and why given materials are selected, is a key step in the Engineering process. In this course, students will learn about the different classifications of materials, how their atomic structure and processing leads to the desirable properties needed for industry. Laboratory work will be used to examine the testing techniques employed by materials engineers to determine the properties and which processes are best suited for a given material. Students will be challenged to select the correct material for a real-world problem through their understanding of mechanical, chemical and structural properties of materials. The delivery of course content is through a combination of lectures, tutorials, laboratories and project work. No prior science knowledge is required to undertake this course.
