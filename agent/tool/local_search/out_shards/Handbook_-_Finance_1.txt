Finance is a study of financial and capital markets. It is concerned with decision making within those markets, and how values or prices of financial assets are determined. Finance is also concerned with investment decisions (for example, selection among alternative projects, selection of securities to include in a portfolio), financing decisions of a firm (dividend policy, debt and equity structures, and lease purchase decisions), and the development of risk-hedging strategies so as to minimise the damaging effects of adverse movements in share prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and other uncertainties in domestic and international financial markets.
This specialisation is not to be undertaken by Finance Co-op students.
