This course will introduce you to the fields of robotic fabrication and collaborative robotics, which are emerging technologies for the built environment. This course will provide you with technical skills to operate collaborative robotic systems whilst identifying novel applications for arts, design, and architecture. You will build a theoretical understanding of robotic applications for the built environment and the impact they could have on the built form in the future. You will be introduced to foundational programming knowledge and designing for robotic fabrication to carry out their applications. Through laboratory-based design exercises, you will investigate 2D and 3D works using the robot arm. You will design, generate, and reflect on your own robotic applications based on your own discipline.
