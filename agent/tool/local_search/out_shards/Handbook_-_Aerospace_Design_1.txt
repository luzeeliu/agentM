Aerospace Design 1 provides students with a grounding in aerospace design, in terms of both structural design and aerospace systems. In this course, you will consider the safe design of aerospace structures, through learning to access and use approved material data, understanding critical regulations, applying appropriate safety factors, and combining this with detailed structural analysis to produce technical design reports. You will also be introduced to a range of aerospace systems, and delve into the design drivers and redundancy requirements for flight safety, as well as exploring different systems implementations for mission requirements. To consolidate learning, the final experiential project requires you to work in small teams to design, manufacture, and test to failure a representative aerospace part, demonstrating structural strength requirements.
Students are expected to have a sound understanding of engineering design and drawing, statics and free body diagrams, manufacturing, aerospace structural analysis, and flight performance prior to attempting this course.
