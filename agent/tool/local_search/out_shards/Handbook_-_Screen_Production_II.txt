This course provides you with a practical understanding of film language, narrative and pre-production processes. By exploring the construction and use of images and sounds through workshop exercises and case studies of specific film practices, you will gain an understanding of the technical, aesthetic and sensory workings of screen production. You will develop a basic understanding of how film language works and in so doing will develop an understanding of the creative potential of the medium. In this course you will explore ways of preparing narrative outlines and storyboards, learn how to capture and generate images and sounds, experiment with existing images and sounds and the editing process. The course will explore the creative potential of audio-visual media and deal with a range of practical and conceptual problems in developing group projects.
