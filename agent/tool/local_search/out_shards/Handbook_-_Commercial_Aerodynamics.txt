This course introduces students to the aeronautical knowledge training required by Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 Part 61 Manual of Standards for commercial pilot licence level Aerodynamics, specifically the Commerical Aerodynamics - all aircraft categories (CADC) and Commercial Aerodynamics - aeroplane (CADA) units of competency. The course explores key concepts of commercial aerodynamics, with a focus on understanding aerodynamic concepts applicable to low-speed propeller driven aeroplanes, and the relationship between theoretical aerodynamics concepts and design features, controls and limitations found in low-speed propeller driven aeroplanes. A combination of synchronous learning and discussion is used to teach key concepts, knowledge and skills, and homework and class quizzes are also provided to students to assess retention and understanding of their learning.
