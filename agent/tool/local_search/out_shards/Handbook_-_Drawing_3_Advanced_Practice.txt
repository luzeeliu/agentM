This course focuses on expanding the artistic strategies, concepts, and vocabulary of your drawing practice in the context of contemporary art. By making and learning in the studio, you will be encouraged to explore new ideas, materials, processes, and technologies as well as consolidate your existing skills and knowledge in drawing. A significant focus of this course is planning, developing, and completing a self-initiated body of work that demonstrates an advanced, independent enquiry into drawing. To assist you in doing this, the course offers diverse conceptual and thematic frameworks, and concentrates on identifying resonances with other artists’ ideas, techniques, and processes.
