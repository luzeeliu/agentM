Overview
The course will cover some basic notions and techniques of number theory. The focus will be on such topics as divisibility, prime numbers, the arithmetic of residues rings, additive properties of integers and their powers and Diophantine approximations. Some applications of number theory to cryptography will be discussed as well.… For more content click the Read More button below.
The course will cover some basic notions and techniques of number theory. The focus will be on such topics as divisibility, prime numbers, the arithmetic of residues rings, additive properties of integers and their powers and Diophantine approximations. Some applications of number theory to cryptography will be discussed as well. Students taking this course will develop an appreciation of the basic problems of number theory and will learn the interplay between number-theoretic problems and other areas of mathematics.
The ability to provide logical and coherent proofs of number-theoretic results, and the ability to solve concrete number-theoretic problems will be paramount. It is planned that it will be suitable for students in both ordinary and advanced programs.
It is recommended to take it together with MATH3711, which will provide students with very useful complementing knowledge and skills.
