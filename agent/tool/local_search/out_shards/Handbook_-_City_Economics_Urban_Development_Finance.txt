City Economics, Urban Development and Finance introduces the application of economic theory to the planning imperatives which drive and shape urban development. You will consider broad spatial-economic factors which shape our understanding of how cities ‘work’ including land use pressures, supply and demand, location theory, opportunity costs, marginalism and the effects of technological transformation. You will also examine the processes involved in land and property development in market economies and the role of government supervision through regulatory and approval processes.
