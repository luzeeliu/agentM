Description
Topics include: plant-animal interactions, including herbivory, seed dispersal and pollination; biological invasions; disturbance, including life in fire-prone ecosystems and the effects of human influences on plant communities; plant regeneration, including reproduction and mating systems, and seed and seedling ecology; evolutionary radiations; plant ecological strategies. We incorporate evolutionary, population and community approaches to plant ecology, and include examples from Australia, and around the world. The course is not lecture based – rather, weekly meetings will be based on discussions facilitated and led by both lecturers and students.
A five day field excursion during mid-session break is compulsory and will involve expense to individual students.
