This course covers theory, evidence and current issues at the intersection between development economics and political science. We will focus on selected topics, aimed to provide an integrated understanding of some critical aspects of the political and institutional circumstances around economic development and the tools used by economists to analyse the roots of economic and political development. At the end of this course, students will have an in-depth understanding of the distinction between some of the functional causes of economic (under)development and be able to assess the potential effectiveness of proposed policies. Furthermore, students will have the tools necessary to carry out independent critical analyses of institutions and their effects on economic development.
