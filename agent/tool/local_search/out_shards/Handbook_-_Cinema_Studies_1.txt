This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
Specialising in Cinema Studies as part of your Bachelor of Media at UNSW will equip you with the theoretical, historical and cultural frameworks to understand how and why moving image cultures continue to shape global media industries in the 21st century.
Hone your critical voice while developing skills in close and careful film analysis and deepening your understanding of the intersections between popular entertainment, politics and aesthetics. Our courses enable you to study film and related media forms in their historical, cultural, and technological contexts and provide you with an international perspective on the place and history of film in the global media landscape, as well as here in Australia.
When you graduate, you’ll be ready for a wide range of career pathways in creative and cultural industries, including film journalism, festival programming, distribution, advertising, policy and education.
