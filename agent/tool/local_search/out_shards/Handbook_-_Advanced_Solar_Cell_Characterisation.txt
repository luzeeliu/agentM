PV researchers and manufacturers employ a variety of instruments to characterise the performance of solar cells and PV materials. By simplifying the usability of these instruments, users are now able to obtain data on the electrical, optical and structural properties of solar cells in a few minutes or even seconds. However, using these instruments without proper understanding of the techniques and models used to obtain this data, can result in improper measurements or incorrect interpretation of the results.
The aim of this course is to help students understand standard techniques employed in the optical, electrical and structural characterisation of solar cells. The course will describe the physical setups, the data acquisition techniques and the models used to interpret the data. By understanding these three key elements students will be able to determine limitations of the characterisation techniques, validity of the data obtained and implications of the measured data based on the models used to interpret it.
