Climate change and sustainability are key challenges for our society and economy today and these areas provide great opportunities for future employment. Governments and non-governmental organisations around the world have engaged in various climate change mitigation and adaptation policy initiatives to ensure survival and prosperity of current and future generations.
This course explores issues related to climate change and sustainability and the implications for businesses that will lead to better business reporting. Insights on established and proposed policy frameworks will provide students with an overview of the trends in sustainability reporting and the ability to start preparing a sustainability report in their current or future employment. Impact of the recent establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) by the IFRS Foundation will also be covered particularly the release of sustainability standards and how Australia is responding to this generational shift in business reporting. Finally, the credibility enhancing mechanisms used to increase trust in sustainability reports will also be discussed and in particular how this may deter organisations from greenwashing.
