INFS3701 is a Level 3 Information Systems (IS) course that extends your knowledge of IS networking infrastructure, cybersecurity, and governance, with a focus on enterprise-level cloud solution architecture. Building on concepts from INFS1701 (Networking and Cybersecurity) and INFS2701 (Cybersecurity Management and Governance), this course explores how modern organisations architect and manage scalable, secure cloud systems.
The course is structured around three key areas of learning:
Architecting Scalable Cloud Infrastructure: Learn how to deploy and scale cloud-based systems using various architectural models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
Cloud Security and Governance Guardrails: Explore how to secure cloud environments through proactive governance practices and automated guardrails. This includes identity and access management (IAM), policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, and incident response planning to ensure cloud systems remain resilient, secure, and aligned with organisational policies.
Service Delivery of Enterprise Cloud: Examine the organisational and operational aspects of delivering enterprise cloud services. Topics include Quality Assurance (QA), Incident Management (IM), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs), with emphasis on IT governance and service management.
By the end of the course, you will be equipped to architect, implement, and manage enterprise-level cloud solutions aligned with security, scalability, and governance best practices.
