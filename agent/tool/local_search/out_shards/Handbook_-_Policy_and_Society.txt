Does political change happen only in Canberra? Why do governments make decisions that leave people behind? What is power and can anyone possess it, or just the people in charge? Does lived experience matter when it comes public policy? When the govt releases a new budget, how does that affect you?
We tend to think about policy decisions – such as a budget – as being made from the top down. But is this always the case? In this course you’ll analyse public policy by looking at different case studies and examples, to see what key concepts such as ‘power’, ‘ideology’, ‘evidence’, and ‘stakeholders’ look like in the real world. We’ll explore on what basis do governments make decisions and how they learn from mistakes.
Through interactive lectures, vibrant classroom discussions, and key case studies, this course invites you to think about ways that policy creates social change and how it can be a tool to create the world you want to see, one policy at a time.
