This course builds the foundation and functional knowledge about information systems by exploring how organisations can leverage new technologies, data and business processes to build digital capabilities needed to compete in an ever-changing digital economy. The course will focus on the value of digital capability, the systems technologies that support and enable digital capabilities, and the building and management of digital capabilities.
Drawing upon real-world problems and challenges, students will apply the use and suitability of contemporary and emerging tools and technologies to a variety of contexts and scenarios. This will culminate in an appreciation of how these technologies affect: the operation and management of businesses; the relationships that businesses have with external entities (including customers, suppliers and regulators); and the products and services that businesses can offer.
