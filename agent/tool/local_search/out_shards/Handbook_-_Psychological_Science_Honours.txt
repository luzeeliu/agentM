The purpose of Honours in Psychology is to enable students who have performed well at undergraduate level to deepen their knowledge of approaches, perspectives and traditions in psychology and undertake a significant research project. Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Masters by coursework, a Masters by research, or a PhD.
Students conduct a year-long, 30 UOC major independent research project (completed under the guidance of an academic supervisor), and write a thesis based on the project. In addition, students complete 18 UOC of advanced-level core and elective coursework in both Term 1 and Term 2.
The research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology, such as: psychopathology, behavioural neuroscience, cognitive science, cognition and perception, forensic psychology, and social, personality and developmental psychology. The project culminates in a written thesis, which is assessed independently by two academics (neither of which is the student's supervisor).
The coursework requirement includes content that encompasses history, professional ethics, evidence-based practice and advanced coverage of selected contemporary issues in psychology that reflect the expertise and research specialisations of School staff.
The Honours year commences in late January/early February and is undertaken full-time over one year. Mid-year entry and part-time enrolment are not available.

Admission Requirements
Entry Requirements

Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
The number of places available for Honours varies from year to year and depends upon the availability of School resources.
Internal applicants
An internal applicant is a student who completes an APAC-accredited undergraduate (or bridging) sequence in psychology at UNSW the year immediately prior to commencing Honours. For example: a student completing at any point during 2020 will be considered an internal applicant for the 2021 Honours year.
The minimum requirement for eligibility for entry into the Honours year is to achieve a
Psychology Average
of at least 75.
For undergraduate bridging sequence students the
Psychology Average
is calculated based on first attempt marks for all courses completed (i.e., from PSYC5001 to PSYC5010).
For undergraduate sequence students the
Psychology Average
is calculated based on first attempt marks for
psychology core courses common to all psychology programs / specialisations
(see below); and the
three highest
first attempt marks of any completed Level 3 psychology electives.
Psychology core courses common to all psychology programs / specialisations: PSYC1001, PSYC1011, PSYC1111; PSYC2001, PSYC2061, PSYC2071, PSYC2081, PSYC2101; PSYC3001, PSYC3011.
NOTE:
Neither Level 1 PSYC electives nor psychology courses taken at another institution count towards the
Psychology Average
.
Completion of PSYC3371 Multivariate Data Analysis for Psychology, in conjunction with PSYC3001, is important as preparation for the Honours year. Students can take PSYC3371 as a Stream A or Stream B elective.
External applicants
The number of places available for external applicants (if any) varies from year to year and depends upon the availability of School resources.
The minimum requirement for eligibility to apply for the Honours year is to complete an APAC-accredited undergraduate (or bridging) sequence in psychology, with a Psychology WAM of 80 or better, within the last 10 years. Anyone with international psychology qualifications must have them assessed by the
Australian Psychological Society (APS)
prior to submitting an application.
