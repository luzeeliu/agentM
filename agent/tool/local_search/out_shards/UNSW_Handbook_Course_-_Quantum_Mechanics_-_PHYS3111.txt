Description
Quantum mechanics is a cornerstone of modern physics, and deals with physical phenomena on microscopic scales. This is a highest undergraduate course in quantum mechanics, and will provide students with a broad and comprehensive introduction and a foundation for further study. Topics to be covered include: Quantum mechanics in three dimensions. Angular momentum. Hydrogen atom. Landau levels. Spin. Identical particles and spin-statistic relation. Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients. Time-independent perturbation theory and applications: Particle dynamics in 1D weak sinusoidal potential, band structure, Bloch theorem, Brillouin zone, quasimomentum, metals and band insulators. Time-dependent perturbation theory. Fermi Golden rule. Adiabatic evolution and Berry phase. Particle wave analysis in scattering theory. Born approximation Dispersion relation for scattering amplitude.  Low energy and resonance scattering.
