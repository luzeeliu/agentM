Why not join the rich, vibrant and diverse community of French speakers around the world and become a global citizen? The French-speaking world represents one of the biggest international linguistic zones in the world with an estimated 321 million speakers spread on all 5 continents.
This course will take you through the basics of language acquisition and introduce you to elements of French culture: you will gain the basic competencies necessary to speak and write about yourself, your family, your friends and your personal preferences, and teach you how to introduce yourself and interact appropriately in a professional environment.
By the end of this course, you will be able to order dinner in Paris, introduce yourself to your new French-speaking colleagues or make friends with Francophone citizens from all over the world. You will also be given the essential tools to further your discovery of the language and embark on a learning journey that may never stop... Fall in love with the language and culture and start dreaming about your next holiday or your future work assignment, we are here to help you achieve your goals.
This course is a beginners-level language course. All students who have had some experience with the language, either as a heritage language or through previous instruction, must fill in the placement questionnaire available at
https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements
