Graphs are fundamental objects in combinatorics, which can be used to model the relationships between the members of a network or system. They have many applications in areas such as computer science, statistical physics and computational biology. Specifically, a graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges, where an edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices.
This course is designed for Honours and postgraduate Mathematics students. Through a series of seminars and tutorials, students explore various aspects of graph theory, including: matchings, coverings and packings, connectivity, graph colourings, planar graphs, extremal graphs and Ramsey theory, the probabilistic method, random graphs. There is an emphasis on proof in this course.
