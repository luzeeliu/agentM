The Greek language, however intricate, is more than yet another foreign language; it is the key to unlocking a great culture that is the backbone of our modern civilization. In this course you are introduced to the Greek language and you will begin to learn functional Greek, which can be used in everyday life in Greece. You are exposed to the Greek alphabet to make reading and writing possible as from the first week of classes. Basic grammatical and syntactical aspects of Greek are introduced through oral, listening and reading activities. The morphology and structure of the language is presented in the context of culturally relevant topics which concern the modern Greek world like popular culture, music, cuisine, travel, traditions, cinema and current affairs.
This course is a beginners-level language course. All students who have had some experience with the language, either as a heritage language or through previous instruction, must fill in the placement questionnaire available at
https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/hal/study-us/resources-support/language-placements
. You will not be permitted to enrol in a language course that is too easy for you. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.
