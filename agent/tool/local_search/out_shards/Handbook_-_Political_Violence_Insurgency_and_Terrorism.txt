This course introduces you to the key concepts, unifying themes, trends, central actors and issues (causes and strategic responses) in the study of insurgency and terrorism in the 20th and 21st Centuries, but with an emphasis on the evolution of the phenomena since the end of the Cold War. In doing so, the course reflects on some of the historical and more enduring forms of political violence—asymmetric and irregular warfare—which draw attention to the underlying and fundamental causes of rebellion/terrorism and responses to it. You will explore how non-state armed groups organise themselves, extract resources, deploy violence, attract recruits, and both fight and negotiate with states. You will also explore the nature and challenge of global terrorism across levels of analysis, focusing on the responses and strategies of both non-state and state actors. This course utilises perspectives and knowledge drawn from international relations, political science, history, terrorism and counter-insurgency studies to examine, in a holistic manner, the phenomenon of contemporary political violence.
