This postgraduate engineering capstone course centres around the application of advanced knowledge and skills to address real-world challenges within the broad field of electrical engineering covering disciplinary areas such as telecommunications, power and energy, control and automation, electronics, signals and systems, etc. Emphasising a problem-solving approach, the course integrates and extends prior learning through a series of assessments that are completed collaboratively. Students engage in authentic experiences, tackling complex engineering issues and fostering critical inquiry and creativity. The course encourages independence, teamwork, and innovation. Through a blend of lectures, tutorials, work-based activities, and supervision, the course not only equips students with a deep understanding of their chosen field but also empowers them to navigate the complexities of professional engineering practice. The active dissemination and celebration of project outcomes further highlight the collaborative and problem-solving nature of this capstone experience, where students emerge with the skills and confidence to excel in their engineering careers.
Note: This capstone project is not equivalent to an honours thesis or a master’s thesis, which may be required to be eligible to apply for a PhD. Please refer to the HDR application process website for details on eligibility requirements
