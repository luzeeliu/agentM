Admission Requirements
Entry Requirements
Expand all
Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
The minimum entrance requirement is completion of an accredited four-year, or three-year plus a fourth year, APAC-accredited sequence in psychology, including a major research thesis, completed within the last 10 years with Honours Class 1 (85%), or Upper Second Class Honours (75%) or their equivalents.
Psychology qualifications from overseas must include a major research thesis/project and must be assessed by the Australian Psychological Society (APS) as comparable to a four-year APAC-accredited sequence of study in psychology completed in Australia.
As the number of places available each year is limited, entry into the program is competitive. Selection is based on academic qualifications, two referee reports, and performance at an Assessment Centre. Only shortlisted applicants will be invited to attend the Assessment Centre, and the Assessment Centre must be attended in person.
Applicants should refer to the School of Psychology's
How to Apply
page for more detail about the application procedure and requirements.
While work experience is not an admission requirement, applicants with employment histories will be positively regarded. An applicant’s employment history does not necessarily need to include clinically- or forensically-relevant experience; a track record of employment could indicate an applicant’s familiarity with team environments (or, conversely, autonomous work), working to deadlines, managing stressful situations, dealing with the public, and any number of other skills
Registration as a Provisional Psychologist
Enrolled students must register as provisional psychologists prior to program commencement. Registration must be maintained for the duration of their enrolment.
Prospective applicants, regardless of current residency or citizenship status, should familiarise themselves with the
registration standards
and are encouraged to review AHPRA's "
Pathways diagram
" relating to the English language skills standard.
Inherent Requirements

Internship, Placement and Exchange Opportunities
The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) Accreditation Standards require candidates in this program to complete a minimum of 1000 hours in professional placements.
Compulsory Training Component
The Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) Accreditation Standards require candidates in this program to complete a minimum of 1000 hours in professional placements.
Progression Requirements
Each Professional and Ethical Practice (PEP) course is linked with either 1) a Readiness Module (PEP 1) or 2) satisfactory progress on or successful completion of a professional placement (PEP 2 through PEP 6). Until the Readiness Module or any professional placement component of a PEP course have been successfully completed (or satisfactory progress has been made), a PE grade will be applied to the course. Failure to meet placement requirements and/or successfully complete the placement (as determined by both the Placement Coordinator and Program Director) will lead to failure of the PEP course. If the Readiness Module or any professional placement is not completed to a satisfactory standard, or placement requirements have not been met, a UF grade will be applied to the PEP course. Hours from a professional placement that is not completed to a satisfactory standard will NOT count towards the minimum 1000 hours of supervised practical placement experience required for completion of the program.
Should a student fail a course*, approval to re-enrol in the failed course will be at the discretion of the Program Director (and Placement Coordinator, in the case of PEP courses)^. If approval is not granted, the Program Director may recommend discontinuation from the program.
* Any of the 16 courses required for the program, including thesis and PEP courses.
^ In Australia, the psychology profession is regulated by the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act as overseen by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). The School of Psychology is responsible for adhering to federally legislated professional and accreditation standards for training provisionally registered psychologists in full compliance with the APS Code of Ethics and Ethical Guidelines. Master of Psychology students, as provisionally registered psychologists, are expected to display the competencies, professionalism and reputable behaviours the discipline demands. In making their recommendation, the Program Director will consider these factors not simply from an academic standpoint, but as the discipline's chief authority on such professional and ethical matters within the program.
Should a student disagree with a recommendation made by the Program Director, their avenue of appeal will be to the Head of School and/or School Board.

Each Professional and Ethical Practice (PEP) course is linked with either 1) a Readiness Module (PEP 1) or 2) satisfactory progress on or successful completion of a professional placement (PEP 2 through PEP 6). Until the Readiness Module or any professional placement component of a PEP course have been successfully completed (or satisfactory progress has been made), a PE grade will be applied to the course.
