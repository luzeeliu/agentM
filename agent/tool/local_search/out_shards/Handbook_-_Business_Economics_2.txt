Full-time and part-time study is available in this specialisation, with students being admitted in Term 1 and 3.
The Honours year provides students with an opportunity to deepen their knowledge of business economics and to develop the necessary skills to tackle the business economics issues and challenges that they will encounter throughout their careers. Students learn and put into practice the skills needed to conduct an independent and original research project and to communicate and defend the results of their research. Graduates with an Honours degree from the School of Economics at UNSW have moved on to successful careers in both the public and private sectors and academia.
The Commerce Honours Business Economics specialisation is designed for students with the equivalent of a BCom degree with a major in Business Economics, Financial Economics or Business Strategy and Economic Management. There are prerequisite courses for the Business Economics specialisation that may be in addition to your specific major requirements and that must be completed prior to your Honours year.
To satisfy the Honours requirements, students complete an additional year of study, including Honours level courses (both compulsory and elective) and a research thesis in business economics.
