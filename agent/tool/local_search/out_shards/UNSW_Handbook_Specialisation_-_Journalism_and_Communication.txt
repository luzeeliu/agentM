Journalism and Communication
Description
Journalists and communication professionals play a critical role in society, whether reporting from a conflict area, chronicling the movements of world leaders, providing sports commentary, or as a spokesperson for an NGO or corporation.
The communication landscape is constantly changing. The UNSW Master of Journalism and Communication is designed for journalism and communication professionals seeking to refresh and refine their skills to keep up with emerging technologies, cultural and social changes, and contemporary international perspectives.
You will develop specialist knowledge and professional skills framed by interdisciplinary study into the social, cultural, economic and political roles of journalism, media and communication, locally and globally.
PRACTICAL COURSES TAUGHT BY INDUSTRY LEADERS
Our courses are designed around practical assessments, including journalistic work in print, digital and broadcast formats, as well as strategic communication materials. You will build an in-depth understanding of the contemporary communications landscape; media relations; digital literacies and social media; investigative journalistic practices; ethical professional practices; and collaborative team work practices.
You can also pursue an internship to further complement your training.
