This double degree program gives students the chance to develop their skills and knowledge in two areas - the major area of interest leading to a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree plus an additional area leading to a Bachelor of Engineering Science degree. Students have a pathway to enhance their professional opportunities through developing cross-disciplinary skills and knowledge within a five year program.
With this double degree program, students take the 168 units of credit core of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) 3707 and the 96 units of credit core of the Bachelor of Engineering Science program 3706. Because of the overlap of 24 units of credit of engineering courses in both cores, the total units of credit required for completion is 240 UOC, rather than 264 UOC. Students should seek advice from The Nucleus: Student Hub.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC (after the 24 UOC reduction from double counted courses).
Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (168 UOC)
A 168 UOC Engineering specialisation
At least 60 days of approved Industrial Training experience
6 UOC Free Elective*
Bachelor of Engineering Science (96 UOC)
A 96 UOC Engineering Science specialisation
6 UOC Free Elective*
In this double degree students complete 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering Science, for a total of 264 UOC. Because the courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC.
*Students are also required to complete 12 UOC of Free Electives. These can be used to take Engineering or non-Engineering courses. Students take these free electives with 12 UOC freed up from overlapping courses. The set of overlapping courses varies depending on the combination of Engineering (Hons) specialisation and Engineering Science specialisation.
Depending on the chosen combination of Engineering (Hons) specialisation and Engineering Science specialisation there may be additional overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses (on top of the required 12 UOC of Free Electives) to bring the total to 240 UOC. Students must take these additional electives from Faculty of Engineering.

keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
Engineering Science Specialisations
keyboard_arrow_down
The Engineering Science specialisation component requires completion of 96 UOC of Engineering courses, chosen from those listed in the relevant BE (Hons) discipline specialisation.
At least 24 UOC of these courses must be from Level 3 or above. For CVENJ1, the Civil Engineering Science specialisation, at least 36 UOC of the courses must be from Level 3 or above.
