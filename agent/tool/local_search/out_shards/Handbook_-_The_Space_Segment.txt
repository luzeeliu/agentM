This course gives the students a basis in the design issues involved in the engineering of the space segment in order to enable to fulfil the mission.  This course covers three areas of the space segment design: 1. Design methodology for satellites; 2. Operational environment, including thermal, structural, electromagnetic environment; 3. Hardware/devices/components introduction of the space segment, incorporating the payload types and satellite supporting subsystems. Examples of current and past space missions are used to illustrate the design process and design implementation associated with the space segment of the mission. Where appropriate, theory associated with the preliminary analysis of the operation and performance of the space segment is also presented. This course delivers to the student a broad overview of the engineering principles involved with the design, development, testing and implementation of the space segment of a space mission.
