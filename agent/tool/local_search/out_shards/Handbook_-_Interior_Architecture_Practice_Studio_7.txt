Interior Architecture Practice Studio 7 focuses on the agency of the interior in the context of the urban morphologies and civic typologies of the twenty-first century city. This final year studio provides an environment that mirrors a professional design practice in which you will refine, synthesise, and communicate the knowledge and skills acquired in previous studios with proficiency. You will engage in research and translate this research into a design proposition. The research phase of the studio includes site, heritage and context analyses, which in turn will inform your development of a project brief. You will prepare the brief in the form of a Design Research Report and use this as the basis for preparing an initial design response. The outputs of this studio, the design research, design brief and design proposition, form the basis of your final design studio, Design Practice 8.
