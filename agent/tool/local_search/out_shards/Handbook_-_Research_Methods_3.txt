This course builds on the data analysis methods and concepts developed in PSYC2001, providing further essential knowledge in statistical methods for students undertaking a major in psychology. The course will explore various experimental designs involving between- and within-subjects factors that can be analysed with some form of analysis of variance (ANOVA), which constitutes a staple statistical approach across the breadth of the psychology literature. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of simultaneous test procedures and simultaneous confidence intervals to produce coherent analyses of data from complex experiments. Lectures will provide the theoretical foundations for the various analysis methods, which will then be put into practice in the tutorials.
