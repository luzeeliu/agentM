Nuclear physics is fundamentally concerned with understanding the nature of matter at the sub-atomic level, the physical principles that mediate interactions between sub-atomic particles, and the impact these have in the broader context of the observable Universe. Starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics, a picture of the structure of nuclear material can be formulated that explains many key experimental observations, including nuclear stability, radioactive decay, and exotic fundamental particles. Associated technological advances include the development of analytical tools such as neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance. From a societal perspective, nuclear physics underpins developments such as nuclear energy, medical imaging, radiotherapy, and advanced manufacturing technologies.
This course is designed to explain the physical principles behind nuclear structure and processes, and to develop quantitative tools for solving problems involving nuclear decay. The course will also provide practical experience in characterising radioactive processes and the interaction of radiation with matter. The course will cover applications of nuclear physics beyond nuclear engineering, including neutron scattering techniques, high energy particle and accelerator physics, and astrophysics.
