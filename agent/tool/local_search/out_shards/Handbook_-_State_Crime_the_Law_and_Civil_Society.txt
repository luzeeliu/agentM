Research into State Crime has developed extensively over the past 25 years and draws on a range of disciplines including Criminology, International Criminal Law, International Human Rights Law, Political Science and International Relations. This course reflects this inter-disciplinary approach and introduces students to a range of perspectives on state organised human rights abuses. Topics covered include: theoretical approaches to state crime; genocide; colonial genocide; war crimes; torture; refugees; whistleblowers; and civil society resistance. One of the main questions posed by this course is: How and why do serious human rights abuses occur? Answers to this question are framed by looking at the roles of governments, perpetrators, victims and bystanders. The roles of the Law, post-conflict Tribunals and Civil Society organisations in identifying, responding and preventing State Crime are also considered.
