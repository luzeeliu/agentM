The purpose of Honours in the Faculty of Science is to enable students who have performed well at undergraduate level to deepen their knowledge of approaches, perspectives and traditions in their chosen scientific discipline and undertake a significant research project. Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program and providing an academic foundation for students continuing on to a Masters by research or a PhD.
As part of the honours program students will be expected to complete a significant independent research project and may be expected to complete coursework. As the Faculty has a diverse range of disciplines the exact proportion of research-based work and coursework may differ by School. Students should refer to the plan pages in this Handbook for details of the different Honours programs.
In addition to conducting research and coursework students will generally also be expected to undertake Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) training, attend and present seminars, write a literature review, and write a thesis.

Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
Admission Requirements and Process
Students are expected to have completed the requirements for a three year full-time undergraduate Bachelor degree  - typically these are a minimum overall WAM (weighted average mark) of a credit, and a completed major within the desired honours discipline. Some disciplines within Science have more specific entry requirements – please visit the
Science Honours Eligibility
page for more information.
Note: This Honours program is the pathway from the following UNSW Science programs: 3980 Bachelor of Aviation (Flying), 3981 Bachelor of Aviation (Management); 3970 Bachelor of Science, 3925 Bachelor of Science and Business, 3965 Bachelor of Science (Environmental Management), 3987 Bachelor of Science (International), 3966 Life Sciences, 3959 Data Science and Decisions (Quantitative Data Science major), 3991 Bachelor of Medical Science and their associated dual degrees.
Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.
Special Admission Requirements

Other
keyboard_arrow_down
To apply for admission to Honours, students should contact the relevant School for information on research projects, available supervisors, and entry requirements. Once student's have located a suitable supervisor, they should lodge an application for Honours to the School by the advertised deadlines. Deadlines for these are found on the School's webpages. Students who have not completed their undergraduate degree at UNSW, or who completed their undergraduate degree at least 6 months beforehand, will need to lodge two applications: one to the relevant School, and another to the UNSW Admissions Office (http://www.unsw.edu.au/node/365).

Recognition of Achievement
Expand all
University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
At the completion of their Honours program students will be awarded an honours grading as follows {note: this is subject to UNSW Policy which is currently under review}:
Honours Class 1: mark of 85 or greater
Honours Class 2 Division 1: mark from 75 to 84
Honours Class 2 Division 2: mark from 65 to 74
Honours Class 3 or Pass: mark below 65
The calculation of class of award will be determined from the student’s weighted average mark for all of the courses (research-based and coursework) required for the program.
Please note that only courses completed as part of the Honours program will be included within an honours calculation.
Honours marks and gradings will be scrutinized at a School level as either part of an Honours Committee or School Assessment Committee to ensure consistency across sub-disciplines and cohorts. The Faculty will also review these marks and grades prior to the release of results.
Additional Information
Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing section below for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
