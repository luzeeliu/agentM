Description
Seeing is an amazing achievement, taking up 40% of the visual cortex. This course will consider how we see and how this reveals and is related to principles of brain functioning. Topics will include stereo (3-D vision), the coding of brightness and colour, perceiving motion and self-motion, brain damage and the question of specialised visual systems, visual imagery, visual attention, and vision and art.
