In this course you will study how historical dynamics have shaped the current global system. We ask "how did we get here today?", by looking at the historical relations between governments and peoples on the continents of Europe, Africa, Middle East, Latin America and Asia.  Using both theory and area studies literature, we will examine how specific assumptions, social formations and territorial claims have contributed to trajectories of development and underdevelopment. Using literatures from the continents concerned, we also examine how key representations of those who were colonized gave rise to resistance and movements for self-determination.
