How would you convince a colleague that your program is correct, and that theirs is flawed?
How do you estimate how long a program will run for, and design test cases to find bugs?
Can all problems be solved efficiently, or are some problems "too hard"?
In this course, you will learn the building blocks to develop problem-solving software in fields as diverse as finance, logistics, policy and entertainment. You will apply techniques including divide-and-conquer, greedy selection and dynamic programming in order to develop accurate and fast algorithms in contexts such as graphs and strings. You will also develop the ability to think critically and communicate about algorithms in terms of correctness and efficiency.
Join us to find out how you can become a better programmer without writing any code.
