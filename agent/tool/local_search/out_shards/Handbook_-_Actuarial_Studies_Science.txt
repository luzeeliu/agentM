3154 Actuarial Studies / Science Specific Information
keyboard_arrow_down
MATH1151 & MATH1251 are compulsory core courses that count towards the Bachelor of Science. Students must complete an additional 12 UOC of UNSW Business School electives to complete the requirement for 96 UOC of Business School courses.
1. MATH1151 Mathematics for Actuarial Studies and Finance 1A (6 UOC) replaces MATH1141 Higher Mathematics 1A (6 UOC)
2. MATH1251 Mathematics for Actuarial Studies and Finance 1B (6 UOC) replaces MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B
This applies to any stream that requires either of these courses.
If MATH1041 Statistics for Life and Social Sciences (6 UOC) is a requirement in a stream, it is replaced by one of the following three courses:
- ACTL2131 Probability and Mathematical Statistics (6 UOC)
- MATH2801Theory of Statistics (6 UOC)
- MATH2901 Higher Theory of Statistics (6 UOC)
If you wish to count MATH2901 and MATH2931 toward the Bachelor of Science degree, you must complete more Business elective courses to meet the minimum Business School Course requirement.
