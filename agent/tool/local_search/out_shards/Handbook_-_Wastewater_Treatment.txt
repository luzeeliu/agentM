Wastewater treatment is crucial to sustaining the human population. Releasing untreated wastewater into the environment has detrimental impacts on human and environmental health from exposure to human pathogens to eutrophication of waterways. Wastewater also contains materials that can be considered resources. Wastewater engineers play roles in designing industrial and municipal wastewater treatment systems (upgrades or from scratch) to meet license standards. They also help solve operating issues and strive to minimise costs and environmental impacts. In this course we take a deep dive into wastewater engineering including process modelling to ensure graduates have a solid understanding of the principals behind unit operations and processes so that you can contribute to the upgrade and design of the treatment plants on which our civilisation is dependent.
