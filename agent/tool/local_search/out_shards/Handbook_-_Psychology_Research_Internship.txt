In this course, students will gain hands on experience of the psychological research process, by undertaking an internship in a lab within the School of Psychology. Workshops will focus on the replication crisis in psychological science, equipping students with knowledge of open science practice and research skills that are relevant to their research lab work. During tutorials, students will learn how to wrangle, visualise, and report data analysis in R. During the course, small groups of students will be assigned to a research lab, and will work collaboratively to reproduce an analysis from their assigned research lab. Students will also attend lab meetings and work with PhD students and honours students on ongoing projects. The internship provides a unique opportunity for students to learn about research that is conducted within the school and to apply their critical thinking skills to the challenges facing the field of psychology.
