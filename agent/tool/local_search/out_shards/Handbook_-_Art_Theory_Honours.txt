The Bachelor of Art Theory (Honours) is a 48 UOC (one year equivalent) advanced undergraduate degree for high achieving students. The program is designed for those who have completed an undergraduate degree in art history and theory (or cognate area), and wish to extend their critical and scholarly skills in art history and theory. The BAT (Hons) program enables students to expand and deepen their knowledge and understanding of art history and theory by undertaking a significant independent research thesis. Supported by coursework in art theory, the program supports students to gain an in-depth understanding of art history and theory and to develop highly sought after analytical, problem solving, and research skills. By doing so, this program can provide pathways to higher degree research programs such as an MPhil or PhD, as well as a diverse array of professional and career outcomes in the arts and cultural sectors.
