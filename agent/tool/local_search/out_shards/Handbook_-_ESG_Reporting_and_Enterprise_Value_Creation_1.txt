This course focuses on the drivers of Enterprise Value creation, emphasizing the need for changes in business decision-making and reporting. It explores the significance of intangible value drivers, including ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors, and the growing importance of the Integrated Reporting Framework for responsible decision-making and transparent reporting on enterprise value over the short, medium and long-term. With ESG reporting gaining traction among investors and new sustainability accounting and reporting standards, the course demonstrates how Integrated Reporting enhances communication of performance and future prospects, enabling more sustainable value creation. Highly interactive with practical illustrations and case studies, this course prepares participants for careers in leading accounting, sustainability and consulting firms, Government and regulatory bodies, NGOs, and innovative corporations, all demanding expertise in sustainability and corporate responsibility.
