This course explores the mechanics, technologies, and practical applications of rock fragmentation and excavation—critical aspects of mining and tunnelling. You will develop a deep understanding of rock breakage and fragmentation theories, rock mass properties, discontinuities, and stress states that influence excavation performance.
The course covers the fundamentals of blasting mechanics, including types of explosives, initiation systems, and blast design for both underground and surface mining. It also examines blast hazard management, vibration control, and the latest advancements in blasting technologies, including alternatives to conventional blasting. Drilling methods and equipment are also explored, with a focus on production drilling techniques, drill bits, accessories, and performance considerations.
In addition, you will study the principles of coal and rock cutting mechanics, cutting tool performance, and rock cuttability assessment. The course delves into advanced excavation technologies, including full-face and partial mining machines, tunnel boring machines, and modern drilling systems.
This course integrates theory with real-world applications, equipping you with the knowledge and skills to tackle the challenges of rock excavation using conventional and emerging mining and tunnelling technologies.
