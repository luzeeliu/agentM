The law specialisation is a collaboration with the UNSW Faculty of Law and Justice and provides the opportunity to complement the core of the MBA program with the advanced study of law and contemporary legal issues.
The MBA (Law) is designed for practising lawyers who are seeking to deepen or refresh their knowledge of law while enhancing their business leadership and management capabilities and networks. It is also designed to allow non lawyers to enhance their understanding of law and contemporary legal topics whilst building their leadership and management capabilities.
For students who have not previously studied law, there are two mandatory core courses that introduce key concepts in law and legal research. Students also have the opportunity to choose from a limited range of electives in law. It should be noted that due to the cadence of offerings in the Law Schedule, electives may be offered less frequently.
