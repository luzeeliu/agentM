This course offers you the opportunity to deepen and expand upon the environment and society change-making knowledge you have gained in previous IEST courses through applied experiential 'in-context' learning. Through Work Integrated Learning (WIL) at UNSW, you will work with a partner organisation external to UNSW (industry, community, or government) on real-world problems and develop your professional practice and personal capabilities. Following approval of your internship or project by the course convener, you will spend at least 105 hours working with your partner organisation (generally 1-2 days per week to fit around the 10 week term), with extra time required to complete assessments, research, and professional development instruction. You may undertake 12 UoC of practicum courses by enrolling in both IEST8001 and IEST8003, either concurrently or in different terms of your program.
To get approval by the course convenor, follow these steps:
1. Email the School (hal@unsw.edu.au) to confirm you meet the prerequisites.
2. Once confirmed, email course convenor
Dr. Sue Schibeci:
suzanne.schibeci@unsw.edu.au
to discuss details (independent vs group internship, etc.).
3. After course convenor approval, email School with evidence of your prerequisite confirmation, course convenor approval, and request to enrol.
