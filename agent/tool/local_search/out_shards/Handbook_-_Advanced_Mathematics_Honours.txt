Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
UNSW Students may be granted Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL) which may or may not reduce the amount of learning required to achieve a degree at UNSW. Generally, RPL is only granted based on the completion of tertiary-level studies, but in exceptional circumstances may also include non-formal or informal learning such as professional experience. RPL will not be granted based on partly completed tertiary courses. All applications for RPL at UNSW are subject to UNSW Recognition of Prior Learning (Coursework Programs) Policy and Procedures. Students seeking credit for courses completed at another university are required to submit documentary evidence (course outlines, academic transcripts) to support their application, and to nominate the course(s) for which they seek credit. In addition, the following conditions apply for all UNSW Science programs (including the Science component of dual award programs): Specified course credit, i.e. credit granted for an exact or near exact equivalence to a course at UNSW, will not be granted when more than 7 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Where this time period is shorter it will be stipulated in the individual rules for the relevant program. Unspecified course credit (e.g. General Education or free electives) will not be granted when more than 10 years has elapsed from the successful completion of the course (or other learning) and the student’s commencement in the Science program. Students may only receive credit of up to a maximum of 50% of the coursework component of their Science program, excluding Honours. For most undergraduate programs this will be 72 UOC. For dual award programs that include a Science component, it will be a maximum of 50% of the Science component of the dual degree, excluding Honours. Credit for the other program will be assessed by the Faculty that administers that program. Applications for RPL will only be assessed for students who have accepted a place to study in a UNSW Science program. Students must formally apply for RPL unless they become a UNSW student as part of a formal Articulation Agreement. Applications for RPL should be made as early as possible in the student’s program. Students who are readmitted into a Science program after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, will not necessarily retain credit for all units completed at UNSW prior to the absence if the date of completion of the units of study is greater than the 7 and 10-year rules outlined in points 1 and 2 above. In these cases, the credit retained will be decided by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) in consultation (when necessary) with the Program and/or Course Authority.
Special Admission Requirements
Expand all
Other
keyboard_arrow_down
Some Schools within the Faculty may grant students exemption from   completing particular first year courses. Where an exemption is given   this is not added to a student's academic record and hence does not   reduce the total units of credit the student must complete for the   program. The exemption merely grants a student the ability to undertake   higher level courses (such as second year courses) that require the   exempted course as a prerequisite. Students with an exemption will need   to be manually enrolled in higher level courses by administrative staff.

Progression Requirements
Progression to Stage 4 is subject to academic performance and requires the completion of a total of 144 UoC and all the requirements of the first three years of the program, including Level I, major, and General Education requirements. To progress to Honours, students are required to have achieved a WAM of 70 or higher in their level III mathematics courses, and a WAM of 70 or higher in the level III courses for their chosen major and honours discipline. Students should seek the guidance of the School of Mathematics and Statistics at an early stage of study to ensure that the study plan being followed is best suited to lead to the Stage 4 Honours. Further information about the honours year can be found at
https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/study-us/undergraduate/honours-degrees/honours-how-apply
Students who are ineligible to progress to Honours, will be required to transfer to the Bachelor of Science program (3970) and graduate with the Bachelor of Science award at pass level. Students should be aware that not all 3956 majors are available in program 3970 (meaning that graduation in 3970 may occur in a less specialised major).
Students enrolled in the Advanced Mathematics (Honours) program who wish to take out the BSc award at pass level without proceeding to Honours are required to transfer to the Science program (3970). Applications to early exit / graduate should be lodged with Student Services during the final term prior to honours.
Students that for any reason transfer from the Advanced Mathematics (Honours) program to the BSc program are not required to take SCIF1000 if at the time of transfer they have already taken one of the following: SCIF1001, DESN1000, COMM1190, MATH3041, MATH3121, MATH3171, MATH3191, MATH3201, MATH3821, MATH3831.

University Medal
keyboard_arrow_down
The University Medal is awarded to recognise outstanding academic performance by a bachelor degree student in line with the University Medal Policy and University Medal Procedure.
Honours Classes
keyboard_arrow_down
Honours
Honours Grades are awarded as follows:-
Honours Class 1: mark or weighted average of 85 or greater;
Honours Class 2 Division 1: mark or weighted average from 75 to 84;
Honours Class 2 Division 2: mark or weighted average from 65 to 74;
Honours Class 3: mark or weighted average below 65;
A student's Honours Grading is calculated only on their performance in the final year of the program based on performance in the thesis and the 5 courses taken as part of the honours year. The thesis contributes 37.5% (90% written thesis and 10% seminar) to the overall honours mark, and the 5 courses each contribute 12.5%.
University Medal
Nominees for the University Medal will be determined by Schools within the Faculty of Science in accordance with UNSW University Medal policies and procedures.
Additional Information
Definition of 'Science' courses
Courses that are classified as 'Science' can be found under Table 1 on the
Science Terminology
page.
Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students, who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing sections for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
Faculty General Rules and Requirements
page.
Choosing Electives
In addition to choosing 'Science' and General Education courses as per the Program Rules above, students may take up to 36 UoC of free electives in the single degree program. These free electives can be taken from any Faculty at UNSW subject to the rule that no more than 72 units of credit of Level I courses (including courses taken for General Education) can be taken throughout the program.
Students may choose to undertake further ‘Science’ courses, or may explore subject areas from outside of Science. For students interested in developing their research skills, the following courses are highly recommended:
SCIF2041 Research Internship A (6 UOC)
SCIF3041 Research Internship B (6 UOC)
