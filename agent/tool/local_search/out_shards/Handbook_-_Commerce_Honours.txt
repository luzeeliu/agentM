Admission Requirements
Entry Requirements
Expand all
Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
To be admitted into the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) program, a student must have completed a pass degree, normally a business-related degree, or equivalent, with a business major in the desired honours discipline (namely accounting, finance, marketing, or information systems). A student in a double degree may gain entry to the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) prior to completing the requirements for the double degree program if they have completed 144 UOC, including 48 UoC in the Bachelor of Commerce compulsory and flexible core courses and all requirements for the relevant major. Students who have completed a non-business degree with a major in one of the specified business areas, or a specified cognate area, may be eligible to complete honours within this program. Disciplines may also have particular pre-requisite requirements for entry into honours. Students are required to meet the entry requirements for the study area they are applying. Please refer to each school's honours entry requirement for exact details.
A student must have an overall Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 70 (or equivalent) with a discipline/major WAM of at least 70. Due to the academic requirements of some disciplines and the competitive nature of honours places, the WAM required for entry may be higher in some disciplines. Students who have failed a course within their pass degree will not normally gain entry to the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) program. Please refer to the relevant discipline Honours plan for exact details.
The availability and willingness of a supervisor to work with the candidate is another important criterion for successful admission to the program. The number of students accepted to the Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) in a particular discipline is dependent on the availability of supervisors in that discipline. If there are more applicants than a discipline can accommodate, admission will be determined according to students' academic merit. Hence meeting the academic requirements of the program does not guarantee a place in the program.
Not all disciplines may accept students mid-year or on a part-time basis due the sequencing of the coursework.
