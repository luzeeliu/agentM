This studio elective focuses on conceiving, researching, and realising creative works that employ generative AI (artificial intelligence). The emergence of generative AI is impacting many aspects of daily life and work, and provides new conceptual and technical possibilities for artists. This course invites students from a range of backgrounds to work in a collaborative studio environment that fosters interdisciplinary and experimental approaches. By introducing you to key concepts, skills, and methods for engaging critically and creatively with generative AI, this course will enable you to work effectively in a landscape of rapidly evolving media technologies. Throughout the course, you will develop skills in experimentation and creative research by working with the latest creative technologies through project-based learning. As you develop your own creative projects, you will be encouraged to explore, interrogate, and integrate current innovations in generative AI and related media technologies, thereby enhancing the conceptual and technical scope of your creative practice.
