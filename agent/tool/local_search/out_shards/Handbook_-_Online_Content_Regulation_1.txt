The course reviews the context of online content regulation through analysis of topics such as the foundations of copyright law, defamation law, etc. It identifies areas of the topic in which online content provides a particular or novel challenge, and then considers and discusses these areas in detail, focussing on theoretical analyses, policy directions, statutory materials and decided cases.
Most topic areas will be treated in a comparative fashion, considering not only the laws in force in Australia, but also the international context in the area, as well as developments in other major jurisdictions such as the US and the UK.
A comparative approach is also encouraged in the assessments, particularly in the research essay.
Main Topics
What unique features of the Internet create the need for new regulatory approaches?
Will a particular regulatory approach achieve its objectives?
What are the advantages/disadvantages of state-based v non-state-based regulatory strategies?
What common regulatory strategies are being used, such as imposing liability on intermediaries?
How do international agreements and the influence of other major jurisdictions (in particular the US) shape Australian laws?
