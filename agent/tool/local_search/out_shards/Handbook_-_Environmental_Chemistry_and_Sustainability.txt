This course will take you on a journey through the main environmental and sustainability issues experienced by our society through the lens of a chemist. You will discover how fundamental chemistry principles can explain the rise of many of these issues but also provide solutions to address them. Together we will answer questions such as: how do human activities affect the quality of water leading to social justice issues? What is the effect of air pollution on our atmosphere and cities? Are solar panels or cloth nappies sustainability-conscious choices? Is plastic recycling worth it? After taking this course, you will be able to make more informed, science-based, and responsible choices when it comes to sustainability in your daily life and current/future workplace. Fundamental scientific concepts that we will explore include but are not limited to the greenhouse gas effect, how solar panels and other renewable energy devices work at the molecular level, the chemistry of waste and contaminants found in water, soil, and the atmosphere. In parallel, you will develop practical thinking skills such as performing the life-cycle analysis to assess the sustainability of many products we use in our daily life and debating/advocating about a certain issue. Real world-inspired laboratory experiences such as the collection and analysis of water samples are also an exciting component of this course.
