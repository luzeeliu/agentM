Stream Outline
Statistics is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.
Stream Structure
A minor in Statistics is comprised of 36 UOC of courses as follows:
Stage 1
MATH1131 Mathematics 1A
(6 UOC)
or
MATH1141 Higher Mathematics 1A
(6 UOC)
MATH1231 Mathematics 1B
(6 UOC)
or
MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B
(6 UOC)
Stage 2 / Stage 3
24 units of credit of level 2 or higher statistics courses, which must include at least 6 UOC at level 3 or higher.
Notes:
Statistics courses are those MATH courses whose second digit is either 8 or 9.
The majority of level 3 Mathematics and Statistics courses require 6-12 UOC of level 2 Mathematics and Statistics courses as prerequisites. Students should be aware of these prerequisite requirements as listed in the Handbook and plan their enrolment accordingly
