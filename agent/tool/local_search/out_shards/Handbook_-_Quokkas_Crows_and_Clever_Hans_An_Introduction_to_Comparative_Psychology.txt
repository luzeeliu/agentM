How do animals think and experience the world around them? How do scientists measure “animal intelligence”? Do dolphins or chimpanzees have language? Can birds plan and problem-solve?
This course will analyse and critique scientific research in the domain of comparative psychology – the science of understanding how and why animals, including humans, process information and respond to the world in the way they do. Each week, students will explore a new question related to key concepts in the discipline (e.g., memory, navigation, communication, tool-use), as well as general scientific concepts such as scientific validity, falsifiability and issues surrounding anthropomorphism.
The course is delivered asynchronously online (pre-recorded lectures that students can access at a time most convenient to them). All assessments will be undertaken/submitted online.
