Spanish is the language of over four hundred million people. It is spoken officially in 23 countries and it is the second language of the United States, where there are some 45 million Spanish speakers. Spanish is also one of the four major languages of the European Union alongside English, French and German.
If you are interested in learning one of the most commonly spoken first languages in the world and have some prior knowledge of the Spanish language, then Introductory Spanish B is the right course for you. Based on a communicative and culture-based approach, this course is designed to help you quickly develop your proficiency in basic oral and written Spanish. Vocabulary and basic Spanish grammar are presented in contexts that are relevant for everyday language use. You will also learn basic language learning strategies to make your learning process more effective. The course introduces you to some facets of Hispanic societies and culture and, in this way, gives you a better understanding of life in Hispanic-speaking countries and also a basic insight into the culture of the Spanish speaking world. We are the first and only university in Australia using the innovative Online Coaching program which offers you a unique opportunity to work outside of class with a personal, native-speaker language coach located in a Spanish Speaking country in a real-time, online learning environment. We hope that this unique personal experience will be truly enjoyable and will motivate you to continue learning Spanish.
