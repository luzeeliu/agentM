This course is only available to students enrolled in the School of Physics Honours Program, and the School’s Honours Coordinator must approve enrolment.
Students will be offered four lecture modules and are required to take two of their choosing. The modules cover the topics of 1) general relativity; 2) quantum field theory; 3) astrophysics; and 4) quantum matter, information and computing.
1) This first course in General Relativity will provide an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry, Einstein’s equation; spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein’s equations (Schwarzschild solution), the weak field limit; Gravitational collapse, black holes; linearised gravity, gravitational waves and their production and observation; Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, the standard hot Big Bang model.
2) The quantum field theory framework combines special relativity and quantum mechanics to explain the subatomic structure of matter and the physics of the early universe. In condensed matter physics, it provides a quantum description of many-body systems. This first course in QFT comprises an introduction to classical field theory, the Euler-Lagrange equations and Noether’s theorem, the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations, the quantisation of free scalar, vector and spinor fields; and a selection of topics other relevant topics.
3) The Advanced Astrophysics module develops in-depth knowledge of topics in modern Astrophysics and equips students with a modern toolset to engage in cutting-edge research. Students obtain a core understanding of the physics of relevant equations and develop fundamental physics intuition.
4) Quantum Matter, Information and Computing will introduce students to selected topics relevant to modern condensed matter physics and to the development of quantum computation. Specific topics include topological effects in materials including the Quantum Hall effect, physical implementations of quantum computing, and quantum error correction.
Students who are approved for Honours will need to enrol in this course in Term 2. This course constitutes 12 UoC out of a total of 24 UoC coursework in the Physics Honours structure. There is also a total of 24 UoC of Honours research project work to be completed over the year.
