Description
This course will review objectives and strategies of renewable energy policy, focussing on sustainable energy transitions, and the integration of renewable energy into electricity markets. The course will introduce the context in terms of policy drivers, policy processes and relevant aspects of energy market structure and regulation. Selection and design of policy instruments, including regulation, taxation, tariffs, targets, incentives and market-based schemes will be explored. Specific policy and regulatory approaches, the views of different stakeholders and interaction with the broader policy regulatory environment will be examined for specific policy case studies.
