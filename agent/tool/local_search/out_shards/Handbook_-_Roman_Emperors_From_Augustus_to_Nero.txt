This course examines the transition of the Roman state from republican to monarchical government.  It covers the period 31 BC – 70 AD, which includes the reigns of Augustus, the Julio-Claudians – Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero – and the first Flavian emperor, Vespasian.  Also examined will be new aspects of Roman political life such as court culture and the role of non-traditional actors including powerful freedmen (ex-slaves), and ambitious women such as Livia, Messalina, and Agrippina the Elder.
The subject will primarily be approached through the surviving histories and biographies of ancient authors, including Tacitus' Annals and Histories, Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars, and Cassius Dio's monumental Roman History, among others.
