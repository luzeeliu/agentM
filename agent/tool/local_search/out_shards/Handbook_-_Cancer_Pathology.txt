PATH3206 aims to promote understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neoplasia. There is detailed discussion of molecular carcinogenesis, the metastatic process and techniques for diagnosis, incorporating recent advances in molecular oncology (genomics, metabolism, immunotherapy, targeted therapeutics, systems biology). Discussion will integrate recent and emerging research findings and develop communication skills and critical thinking. Topics covered include neoplasia of the colon, breast, stomach, skin, lung, and reproductive tract, as well as haematological and paediatric neoplasms.
For those wishing to pursue a career in research or hospital-based laboratory work, the course will not only develop basic knowledge of molecular processes, but also provide a framework for understanding how these processes link to the modern practice of medicine. Similarly, for those who may wish to pursue a career in the health sciences, the course will provide an understanding of the cellular and molecular processes underlying clinical manifestations of neoplasia.
