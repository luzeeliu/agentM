This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The Spanish Studies major specialisation at UNSW enables you to study Spanish at a number of levels in order to attain proficiency. Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced levels. You will not only develop your knowledge of the Spanish language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the Spanish-speaking world. You will study cultures, communities, societies, history, film and literature in the Spanish-speaking world. The Spanish language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Spanish Studies will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in Spanish will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.
There are two main components of the Spanish Studies major. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Spanish language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people's expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Spanish language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Spanish cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical, developmental and social productions.
This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.

If you are undertaking Spanish Studies as a major you may complete some components of your study through cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney. If you successfully complete Spanish courses cross-institutionally you will have your results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, that is, specific grades will not appear on your UNSW transcript.
If you are a Commonwealth-supported student (domestic undergraduate student) in a UNSW program you will pay the student contribution amounts at the University of Sydney for each course. If you are an international student you will pay the corresponding tuition fees.
You will be required to pay the Student Services and Amenities Fees (SSAF) at the University of Sydney. You may seek a refund for the corresponding UNSW fees if you are concurrently enrolled at UNSW.
You are responsible for all travel and any ancillary or incidental costs or expenses.
If you are undertaking cross-institutional study at the University of Sydney you are responsible for ensuring that all the requirements for your application are completed and submitted by the deadlines advertised.
The cross-institutional arrangement with the University of Sydney is subject to annual review by both Universities. It may be discontinued or varied at any time at the Universities' sole discretion. If the arrangement is discontinued, UNSW will put in place alternative arrangements so that students can finish their study.
