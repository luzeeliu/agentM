AI in Action introduces Master of Commerce students to the applied use of artificial intelligence and explores how AI technologies can support automation, communication, coordination, and service delivery across a range of business and institutional contexts. Building on existing foundational  programming skills, you will learn how AI can be embedded into process workflows and integrated with existing information systems to enable new forms of operational capability.
Students will build prototype leveraging large language models (LLMs), audio/speech technologies, generative image and video tools, and autonomous decision intelligence systems. This may include implementing simple chatbot prototypes, deploying knowledge-based autonomous agents, processing audio data from customer service interactions, or generating visual content for marketing. The first step of these innovations would be to communicate AI’s business value to stakeholders by framing impactful use cases and articulating benefits and risks. Afterwards, you will learn how to think algorithmically and then convert it into actual code by co-coding with AI using Python and other low-code tools. You will experiment with integrating new AI components into the existing enterprise systems, e.g., the chatbot prototype could be connected to a company's business information systems (BIS) to augment LLMs’ generic language capability with internal knowledge, including policies, business reports, and complaint resolution processes. Also, the course encourages responsible AI use by guiding students to build solutions with fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability in mind from the start. Ethical considerations are integrated into design choices, aligned with institutional values and the broader impact of AI in practice.
In summary, this course will provide you with practical AI implementation experience, giving you the confidence to lead AI projects, communicate AI’s business value to stakeholders, and integrate AI-driven innovations into your career path.
