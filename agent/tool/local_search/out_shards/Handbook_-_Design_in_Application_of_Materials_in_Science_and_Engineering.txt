The design and selection of materials for applications in industry and society requires an in-depth knowledge of the structures, properties and availability of materials. This course will introduce students to the microstructures and structure-property relationships of the main types of engineering materials (metals, ceramics, polymers and composites), micromechanisms of elastic and plastic deformation, fracture mechanisms for ductile, brittle, creep and fatigue modes of failure in service, phase equilibria of alloys, and the properties and applications to commercial engineering materials.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
