An epidemiological approach to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data is the foundation for public health practice. An understanding of epidemiological principles and methods is fundamental to the design, analysis, and critical evaluation of public health studies. This course has been designed to develop your essential knowledge and skills in the epidemiological principles of descriptive and analytical methodologies used to answer population health questions. You will have the opportunity to calculate and interpret measures used to describe the distribution, determinants, and impact of disease in populations. A major focus of the course is the design principles and critical appraisal of common intervention and observational studies and identification of study limitations and sources of bias, essential for the translation of quality evidence into public health practice and policy.
You are encouraged to enroll in this subject early in your program. If you have concerns about numeracy it is advisable to consider enrolling in the course as an internal student.
