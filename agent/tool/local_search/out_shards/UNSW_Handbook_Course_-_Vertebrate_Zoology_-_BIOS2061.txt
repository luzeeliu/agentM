Description
Australia has a high diversity of vertebrate species (e.g. platypus, tree frogs, parrots, snakes). This course examines the evolution, diversity and natural history of these animals with a special emphasis on how they cope with Australia’s environment. It covers the evolutionary origins and relationships between the major Vertebrate groups and explores their diversity of form, function and behavior. There is a detailed investigation of birds and mammals, particularly their ecology, life history and emerging conservation issues. Practical work involves examining living and preserved specimens (including dissections) and several field trips around Sydney studying vertebrates in the wild.
