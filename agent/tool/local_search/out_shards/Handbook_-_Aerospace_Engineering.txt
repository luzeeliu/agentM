The Aerospace Engineering specialisation covers the analysis, design and operation of aircraft and spacecraft. Graduates work mainly on the design and manufacture of flight vehicles, their operation with major or satellite airlines and research for civil and military aerospace organisations. Owing to the international nature of aerospace industry, the topics studied cover a similar area and, in general, to the same depth of understanding as professional training programs in aerospace in other industrial countries. The aerospace industry is one of Australia's major exporters of high value-added manufactured goods.
