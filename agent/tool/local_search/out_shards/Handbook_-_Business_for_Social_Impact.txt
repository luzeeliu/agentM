COMM5201 Business for Social Impact is an experiential course which enables PG students to gain experience in developing a social business model to address a social gap/need in a profitable way.
Students will learn about the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of social business and how to apply their new and existing knowledge and skills through developing a social business case for a competition. Working in small teams, students will develop and draw inspiration from the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals to identify a social or environmental gap to address.
Students will be coached throughout by experts in innovation and social enterprise.
The course is designed to guide students through a practical innovation process called the Double Diamond, beginning with discovering the problem then defining the problem, before developing the solution and finally delivering the solution, culminating in a presentation.
This course aims to:
Increase students' understanding of how their business knowledge may be applied in practice, in particular in a social business context.
Develop students' collaboration and teamwork capabilities and interpersonal skills.
Develop student's ability to clearly and effectively communicate with diverse groups of people.
Increase students' employability through the development of innovation and creativity skills.
