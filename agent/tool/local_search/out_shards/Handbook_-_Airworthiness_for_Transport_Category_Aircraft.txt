Travel by air is the safest mode of transport in terms of distance travelled and, given the technological complexity involved, is extremely reliable. However, when serious accidents do occur, there is often a significant loss of life and associated extensive public concern and, appropriately, an intense focus on investigating and determining the root cause of the accident and rectifying the situation. The main contributor to ensuring safe air travel is airworthiness of an aircraft, in conformance with its approved design and in a state suitable for safe flight. Airworthiness is at the core of aviation safety and is a constant and vital thread running all the way from the initial aircraft conceptual design through the detailed design, prototype testing and certification, manufacture, entry into service, sustained and reliable operations in-service, maintenance, repairs and modifications throughout its operating life and ultimately to aircraft disposal.
This fully online, distance learning course explores the major phases that constitute airworthiness: initial airworthiness and continuing airworthiness. There is a focus on understanding the regulatory framework and structure associated with airworthiness, design, certification, entry-into-service, continuing airworthiness compliance, conformance and change management, managing acquittal of work, maintenance organisation, and logistics and inventory management.
