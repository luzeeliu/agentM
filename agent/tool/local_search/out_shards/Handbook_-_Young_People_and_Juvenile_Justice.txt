In this course you will develop a critical understanding of the juvenile law system, including legal principles, policing practice, courts, sentencing and imprisonment of young people. The course asks you to reflect on why we criminalise children and the impact this has on the communities they are part of. It takes an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of crime policies that target young people, and asks you to think critically about how these impact marginalised youth in particular. It examines the origins of the juvenile system, current dynamics and emerging influences by drawing on key case studies related to drug use, Indigenous justice, and gender and racial politics.
