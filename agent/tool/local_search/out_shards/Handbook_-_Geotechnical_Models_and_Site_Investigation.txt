This course teaches the concept of Engineering Geological Models as a knowledge framework and thought system for geotechnical design and geohazard assessments.  The course highlights the cognitive science behind development of a model, presents the processes and approaches that have proven successful and discusses the processes that do not work effectively. Different types of models are explained, the model building process is outlined, and the components of models are discussed for different types of engineering projects.
The concept of Total Geology is explained including how it fits into the overall modeling development process as part of the desk study. The use of desk studies is highlighted as an essential method to plan efficient site investigations.
The main field investigation techniques are explained including mapping and sub-surface methods such as drilling and trenching. In-situ testing of soil is covered including SPT, CPT and piezocone. Laboratory testing of soil and rock is introduced including UCS, triaxial, direct shear and ring shear. Field instrumentation for pore pressure and displacement is outlined.
Data acquisition and modelling tools are introduced including engineering description systems, data bias, remote sensing, GIS, photogrammetry, borehole imaging, presentation of maps, plans and sections, 3D modelling, DFN’s.
