Description
Note
: BABS1201 is the new code for
BIOS1201
, effective from Semester 1 2007.
The course is concerned with the basic characteristics of all life. The chemistry of life is examined, with emphasis on the ways in which living things construct and break down macromolecules. The way in which the genetic code controls these processes depends to a great extent on the structure and function of cell components, and cell biology is a major component of the course. The final topic is genetics - the way in which the genetic code is inherited and the ways in which it can be modified.
