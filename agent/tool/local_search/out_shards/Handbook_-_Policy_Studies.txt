This course is offered in two modes: either face to face (on-campus) and fully online.
Public health policy is political. This course teaches what policy is and how to make and influence policy to advance public health. It focusses on how and why issues become matters of policy concern, how policy actors (and which ones) engage in policy activity, how institutions shape policy-making, and how policies are developed and have impact. You will be invited to describe and examine your own experience of policy and policy-making, and develop skills in policy analysis which will help you to navigate and influence the policy environments in which you are a stakeholder. The course is suitable for both Australian and international students.
