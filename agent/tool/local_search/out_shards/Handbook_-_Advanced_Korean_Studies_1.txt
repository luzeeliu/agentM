This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The Advanced Korean Studies major specialisation at UNSW covers the study of the Korean language and the study of the social, cultural and historical aspects associated with the language. It provides you with the opportunity to develop as a highly competent user of the Korean language. You will gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop explicit knowledge of language, and gain knowledge of the social, cultural and historical background of Korean-speaking people. The Korean language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken.
Learning Korean will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Korea and other countries. Developing competence in Korean will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.
This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced entry level.
There are two main components of Korean Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Korean language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other's expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Korean language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Korean culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social studies.
