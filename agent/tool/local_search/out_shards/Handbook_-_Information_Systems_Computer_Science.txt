The double degree program Bachelor of Information Systems/Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) (BIS/BSc(Comp Sc)) provides a comprehensive skill set and a holistic understanding of both the technical and business aspects of technology. The combination of these two degrees will equip the student with a diverse range of technical skills and knowledge in computer science, as well as an in-depth understanding of the business application of technology in information systems, including but not limited to data management, systems development, and digital strategies.
Completing a double degree allows students to explore a more versatile career path. With this degree, students will have the flexibility to pursue various career paths in computer science and information systems, such as systems analyst, software engineer, data scientist, IT consultant, project manager, and cybersecurity specialist.
Both Information Systems and Computer Science graduates are in very high demand. Given the growing pervasiveness of technology and the global demand for tech talent, there is an abundance of job prospects and opportunities for growth in a technology-driven world. A double degree between Information Systems and Computer Science will provide students with a unique and valuable opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between technology and business. Students completing this program will stand out in the job market with a unique double degree that demonstrates their ability to integrate multiple technology-related disciplines and contribute to improving business performance.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 192 UOC.
In this double degree 96 UOC is required for the Bachelor of Computer Science, and 120 UOC is required for the Bachelor of Information Systems for a total of 216 UOC. However, 24 UOC will be double counted towards both degrees (as outlined below), and therefore the total UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) (96 UOC)
Core courses
Computing electives
Bachelor of Information Systems (120 UOC)
Business Core Courses (30 UOC):
3795 students do not need to take COMM1110 as this requirement is satisfied in the Computer Science program. Students will be able to fulfill this requirement by completing MATH pair (e.g., MATH1131/41/51 + MATH1231/41/51).
Information Systems Core Courses (72 UOC)
The completion of COMP1531 will be counted as a substitute for INFS2822 and will satisfy this as a core in the Information Systems program.
Students enrolled in a Computer Science major who require COMP3311 must replace INFS1603 with another Level 2 or 3 Information Systems elective. Similarly, students who require COMP9313 or COMP9315 must replace INFS2608 with another Level 2 or 3 Information Systems elective.
Information Systems Electives (12 UOC)
: CS major elective courses can be counted as IS elective courses.
Work Integrated Learning (6 UOC):
Requirement can be satisfied by taking a Computer Science or IS WIL course.
Once requirements for the Information Systems and Computer Science programs have been met, students take Business electives to ensure a total of 192 UOC is completed for the double degree.

As part of the Bachelor of Information Systems degree, students must complete a 6 UOC Work Integrated Learning (WIL) course, chosen from the below courses within their program, to satisfy the minimum of 150 hours of professional work that is a requirement of the degree. The same 150 hour minimum professional work requirement applies to the Bachelor of Commerce/Information Systems double degree. Students can satisfy the requirement in either the commerce or information system component of the double degree. For the avoidance of doubt, students are NOT required to satisfy the requirement in both components of the double degree.
