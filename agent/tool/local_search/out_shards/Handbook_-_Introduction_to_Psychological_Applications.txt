This course offers an introduction to psychology as a scientific discipline and as a profession, with special emphasis on initiating the academic and professional development of students in the Bachelor of Psychology programme.
The content of this course is structured around the graduate attributes associated with the scientist-practitioner model, the basis for the training of psychologists in Australia and internationally. You will be introduced to diverse areas of professional psychology practice, and a major focus of the course will be research training within a group setting. This course also provides a first step in your development of psychological literacy, that is, the capacity to intentionally utilise your psychological knowledge, skills and attitudes to achieve personal, professional, and societal goals.
In preparing students to “think like a psychologist”, this course will cover topics including critical and creative thinking and fundamentals of research design, as well as providing students with career-relevant perspectives.
