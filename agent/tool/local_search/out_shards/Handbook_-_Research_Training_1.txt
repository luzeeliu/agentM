This course is only available to students enrolled in the School of Materials Science and Engineering Honours Program and must be taken in a student’s first Term of Honours in conjunction with the Materials Science Honours Project course (MATS4505). The School’s Honours Coordinator must approve enrolment.
This course and MATS4503 Professional Skills provide essential introduction to Honours for Science students undertaking a full-time Science Honours program in the School of Materials Science and Engineering. MATS4503 consists of 30 hours of class contact hours and students are expected to take an additional 120 hours of non-class hours spread over the term to complete study and readings, undertake critical review of literature and develop a project proposal, and preparation for seminar. The course results in a written research proposal providing an account of relevant scientific literature and a description of the research work expected to be undertaken during the Honours program, and a short seminar presentation to present these to a scientific audience. The focus of the research proposal is decided in consultation with the student’s Honours Supervisor and is related to the topic area of the research project. Students will also present a short seminar based on their proposal
