Effective data analysis allows us to generate and interpret evidence and answer questions about the natural world. We live in a data rich era, where our ability to gather relevant data is greater than ever. But how do you turn numbers into knowledge? This course develops core skills in the manipulation, statistical analysis, and communication of data. Using examples from the biological, earth, and environmental sciences and using the R programming language, students will examine the role of statistics in addressing scientific questions with different goals, including determining causes, describing variation, and predicting outcomes. Concomitantly, they will gain experience applying common methods using the R programming language. In-person practicals are supported by online lectures and discussions. Skills developed during this course will provide excellent training for all scientists, in research, government, industry, or society.
Assumed knowledge: MATH1041 or relevant undergraduate level of data manipulation and statistical analysis.
