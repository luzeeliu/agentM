Chemical reaction engineering concerns the implementation of chemical reactions on a commercial scale. Its goal is the design and operation of chemical reactors to achieve safe, economic, scalable and energy-efficient production of chemicals. More than any other activity, it likely defines chemical engineering better as a distinct branch of the engineering profession. Starting with understanding what changes are expected to occur in a chemically reacting system by explaining the thermodynamics of the process, you will look into analyses of the rate kinetics of different reactions and, finally, the choice and design of reactors where those reactions can be carried out for optimal production at scale.
This course provides the knowledge base and critical thinking essential to the further learning of unit operations in CEIC3001, process modelling in CEIC3000, and process design in CEIC3005 and CEIC4001. The material in this course is taught from an engineering design perspective.
