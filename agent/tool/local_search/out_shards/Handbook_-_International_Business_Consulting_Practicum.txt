In this capstone course, students work in small groups on a consulting report for a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) interested in international expansion. The projects provide students with an opportunity to integrate, apply, evaluate, and reflect on the knowledge and experiences gained in their degree program. The international business context introduces the additional complexity of different cultures (including values, norms and business practices), and different institutional, political, and regulatory environments that the students will need to navigate as they as they work on their project for their client company. Emphasis is placed on analytical, critical, ethical, innovative, and strategic thinking as necessary thinking skills to deal with real business and societal challenges.
Student teams will be supported by academic staff, a team-mentor with extensive international business consulting experience, and industry experts, to help them deliver the best possible consulting report for their client. Working together with experts and professional consultants will give students the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of careers in global business and international consulting.
