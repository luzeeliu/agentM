With a growing demand for medications, supplements and nutritional products, the pharmaceutical industry has been growing rapidly over the last century. Chemical engineers play a key role in this industry, with contributions in areas ranging from nanoscale design and drug discovery to manufacturing, processing, and distribution. Understanding and implementing modern technologies in the pharmaceutical industry are key to meeting the growing demand for pharmaceuticals.
In this course, you will learn how to design, develop and evaluate pharmaceutical and nutraceutical agents in line with research and industry methods, where chemical engineers, nutritionists and medical researchers work together to transform raw materials and small molecular agents to valuable pharma products. The contents will cover a broad range of competencies in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical sectors, including drug delivery, pharmaceutical design and processing, nanotechnology, drug regulation and approval, with emphasis on new technology innovation, translational process and commercialised healthcare-related products.
The course will be offered in collaboration with relevant pharmaceutical and/or nutraceutical companies, allowing you to use knowledge and skills to solve drug development problems currently challenging the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. This course will set a foundation for a career in the pharmaceutical industry or research in related areas.
