Modern career paths are more dynamic and more varied than ever before. While this creates increased opportunities and flexibility for university graduates, it also presents a challenge in navigating such an uncertain environment. To succesfully navigate and manage your career, you need to be able to deal with opportunities and setbacks. This requires an understanding of the careers literature and how you can apply it to your own career path, as well as an acute awareness of yourself, your values and your goals.
This course introduces students to the knowledge and skills required to successfully manage their careers as they make the transition from university to the workforce. It explores key career management concepts, techniques, tools and processes, with an emphasis on applying theory and research to practical lifelong skill development.
