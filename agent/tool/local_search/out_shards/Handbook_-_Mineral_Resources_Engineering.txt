You woke up this morning and most likely looked at your mobile phone. Did you know that this device alone contains about 50 different elements? It must be charged like all of your electronic devices. But how is the electricity produced? Whether it is from renewable energy sources or not, they all rely on metals and minerals to operate or to be built. Wherever you look you see metals and minerals and as remote as it may seem, all these goods started in a pit. In this course you will develop an awareness for the importance of the mining industry in our lives. Together, we will explore how commodities are extracted from the ground and who are involved at various stages of the mining operation. The topics covered in this course include geology, mining, mineral processing, safety, the impact of mining on the environment, and economics. We will also discuss employability in the mining industry, which employs people of various backgrounds (e.g. geologists, mining engineers, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, process & chemical engineers, lawyers, finance, etc.) and offers competitive salaries. Why not come and learn about one of the pillars of the Australian economy and a potential employer?
