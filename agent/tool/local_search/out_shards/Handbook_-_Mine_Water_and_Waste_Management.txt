Mine water and waste management are critical issues for safe and efficient underground and pit mining operations and to minimise environmental impacts at all stages from feasibility assessment to mine closure. Leading practices for mine site water accounting and assessment will include depressurization and dewatering, geotechnical stability, sustainable water supplies and surface diversions, discharge and pump system management. Fundamentals of hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry for mining will  include monitoring and management of groundwater storage, salinity and acid mine drainage;  potential contaminant migration processes; geochemical reactive  transport modelling and tracing methods. The course will focus on aqueous aspects of mine water including engineered seepage barriers, water recycling and treatment options, with an overview of waste rock and tailings management.
