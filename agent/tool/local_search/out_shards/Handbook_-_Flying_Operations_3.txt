This course is the final stage of training for the Commercial Pilot Licence including the flight test and the introduction of multi-engine and instrument rating flying. The theoretical component covers the underpinning knowledge for a command instrument rating, including Airways Procedures, Radio Navigation Aids, Meteorology and Satellite Navigation taught at a theoretical level and then integrated into practical operations through flight and ground training. The flying training covers the operational aspects of commercial flying and consolidates the elements of the syllabus previously covered. Following the flight test for the issue of the Commercial Pilot Licence, the practical flying shifts focus to the initial multi-engine class rating and instrument rating with a combination of synthetic trainer and multi-engine flight exercises.
