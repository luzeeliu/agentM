Genetics is the study of inheritance and is an exciting and rapidly expanding discipline with applications in medicine, biotechnology, agriculture, and many other fields. This course provides an overview of the key concepts in genetics including gene structure and transmission, genetic variation and evolution, and regulation of gene expression. Laboratory experiments and a research project are used to demonstrate genetic theory and its application and introduce students to real-world genomics research. The course includes self-directed experiments and extended presentations on scientific literature, and is designed for high-achieving students interested in a research career.
This advanced version of the BABS2204 course includes an individual research project carried out throughout the term in addition to the laboratory classes. This course is designed to suit students who plan to pursue research careers in genomics or related disciplines.
