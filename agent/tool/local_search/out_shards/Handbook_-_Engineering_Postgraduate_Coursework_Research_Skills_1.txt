Research skills are critical professional competency for all engineers, computer scientists and food scientists. They are needed in the development of new products, the selection of appropriate technology, the efficient management of processes, and the discovery of new things about the universe, its inhabitants and their needs. More broadly, research skills are a core graduate capability of those with postgraduate qualifications and set them apart through their advanced lifelong learning skills.
This course is designed to equip you with research skills that can be applied in both academic and industry contexts, for example capstone project courses, and product development. GSOE9011 teaches these skills in an online mode using a combination of asynchronous learning modules, live interviews with guest experts, and project-based learning as you collaborate with a small group of students to develop a research proposal.
You will learn how to effectively search for quality information and then to critically review the literature. The course will introduce you to experimental design, as well as explaining how to write effective research project and grant proposals. In addition, you will learn professional skills related to academic integrity, group dynamics and collaboration, research careers and profiles, and advanced presentation skills.
