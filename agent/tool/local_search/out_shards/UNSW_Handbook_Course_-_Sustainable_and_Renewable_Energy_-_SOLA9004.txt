Description
This course includes an introduction to issues in sustainable and renewable energy, including environmental impact, resource depletion, basic engineering economic analysis, embodied energy, payback times and the integration of renewable energy sources with conventional infrastructure. The course reviews key concepts such as basic thermodynamics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics to allow analysis of the physical operation of energy generation systems, with key renewable energy sources and generation systems examined including wind, biomass, solar thermal, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal and wave energy. The course emphasises engineering problem solving, design skills and creative thinking.
This course is offered in parallel with SOLA2053 Sustainable and Renewable Energy Technologies, however, postgraduate students are required to complete additional assessment.
