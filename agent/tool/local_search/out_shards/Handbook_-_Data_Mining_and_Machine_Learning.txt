Recent technological advances have given organisations access to enormous data sets that raise challenges for data analysis. Hence, a wide range of data mining methods and tools have been developed to extract information, discover patterns, and enable predictive decision making. Machine learning is the algorithmic approach to learning from data. This course covers the key techniques in data mining and machine learning together with theoretical background and applications.
The following topics will be covered in this course: regression and classification problems, data mining performance evaluation, gradient descent learning and backpropagation neural networks, tree-based learning and ensemble methods, clustering and dimensionality reduction, and practical aspects of machine learning applications.
