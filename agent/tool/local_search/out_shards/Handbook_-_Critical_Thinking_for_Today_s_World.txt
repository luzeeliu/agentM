This course is designed to provide you with tools for thinking that are essential to any career path or course of study. In a world saturated with information, the tools of critical thinking are more valuable than ever. We take a hands-on approach to skills such as the analysis and mapping of informal reasoning (as found, for example, in media and political discourse), the evaluation of deductive and inductive arguments, and learning how to recognise and avoid common pitfalls of reasoning. We also (gently!) introduce some formal tools for the study of reasoning, including the basics of logic and probability theory. (No maths beyond elementary algebra is required.)
