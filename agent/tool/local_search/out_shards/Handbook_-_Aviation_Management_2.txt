The Master of Aviation Management (MAvMgmt) is designed for managers and professionals who have a University degree, and a desire to gain or further develop skills and knowledge to be effective in a contemporary aviation environment.
The program has been developed by aviation industry and aviation experts with the aim of supporting students to develop a holistic aviation skill set. MAvMgmt students are also provided with an opportunity to embark on an optional specialisation in one of three key areas in aviation management: Human Factors and Aviation Safety, Airline Operations, and Airport Operations, to further refine their learning and provide career direction in the aviation management sector.
The MAvMgmt is offered entirely through distance education, and can be completed as a full-time or part-time study load. Students with full-time employment are recommended to undertake a part-time study load. The online courses are delivered through a secure learning and teaching website, with the core component of learning delivered in a self-paced, asynchronous format. Students do not need to attend any on-campus activities, but there will be opportunities to engage in online, synchronous consultations and skills-focused workshops.
The curriculum includes courses that explore the areas of airline and airport operations, airline corporate management, law and regulation, security, human factors, flight data analytics and accident investigation. Students are also provided with the opportunity to complete a compulsory AVIA5020 Aviation Research Project course as part of the Program. This course is essential for preparing students with the foundational skills that underpin all courses within their Program, setting them up for success. Students are encouraged to take this course within the first two Terms of commencing their Program.
The program is 96 units of credit (or 2 years full-time equivalent) and can be studied on a full-time or part-time basis. Students with appropriate education in a relevant cognate area and/or relevant professional experience may be eligible for advanced standing and may then complete the degree in less time. Eligibility for advanced standing is determined by the School of Aviation on a case-by-case basis. Applicants are encouraged to contact the School for more information on eligibility criteria.
