This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
International development practice and humanitarian action has increasingly become interdisciplinary, attracting a wide range of professionals with different skill sets. This includes engineers, medical professionals, urban planners, media consultants, psychologists, social workers, social scientists, economists, business managers and many others. In addition to disciplinary-specific knowledge, a nuanced understanding of the field in which they work is required.
In a minor in Global Development, you will develop the knowledge and skills to enable you to work in and with the diverse actors of the development sector, including UN and international organizations, donor governments, non-governmental and private sector, community-based initiatives and the community. Courses emphasise interdisciplinary team learning environments that replicate the actual world of development practice. Upon graduation, you will have an understanding of development practices that complements learning in other fields / disciplines.
