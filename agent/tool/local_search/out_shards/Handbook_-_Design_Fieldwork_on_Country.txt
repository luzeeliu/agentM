DDES1000 Design Fieldwork on Country is an object design focussed course that offers the opportunity to engage in field research to inform design and making practice. This intensive residency-based course provides immersion in a specific site, where you will experience learning activities that facilitate engagement with the natural and built ecosystems of the site. Informed by best practice Indigenous design theories and methods, DDES1000 provides the opportunity to develop sensitive work practices with places and people outside of the usual classroom scenario.
Working with the site as the source of primary research, you will learn the skills needed to develop place-based design projects, this will include observation, making, secondary research and collaboration.
