Anatomy is the study of the structure of the human body. The word 'anatomy' is derived from the Greek, and means 'cutting up' or 'dissection'. However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans & non-human primates.
At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.
Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer, forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students for careers in medicine and is especially relevant for clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.
Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.
