This extended course will build upon JURD7555 UNSW Law Internship by applying knowledge acquired during the JURD7555 internship to an in-depth project or other approved project. In completing the project, students will have the opportunity to further develop professional workplace skills and engage in deeper self-reflection and analysis of the experience as a stepping stone into a graduate career. At the end of the course students should be able to scope a legal research project, demonstrate critical and analytical engagement with legal concepts, demonstrate effective communication skills by articulating concepts clearly, persuasively, and appropriately, and to showcase a completed body of work completed on behalf of an organisation.
This is not a stand-alone course but facilitates in-depth learning through extending the JURD7555 internship to application of knowledge acquired particular to that practice area or organisation.
This course must run consecutively (the following term from undertaking JURD7555) or concurrently (at the same time, summer term excepted) with the standard one term internship course (JURD7555). The extended internship course cannot be taken non-consecutively (one term or more between the initial internship and the extended internship). Students must intern with the same organisation in both terms.
Course Work
The extended internship will be taught by individual online supervision with online modules for activities and assessments. Assessment tasks will be flexible and designed to provide a framework to support the student alongside undertaking the project for the host organisation. The project may be in the form of a law reform submission, contribution to websites or blogs, advocacy campaign design, article for publication, presentation, or memo to staff of the organisation. A project proposal must be submitted to the Faculty Director of WIL for approval prior to enrolment.
