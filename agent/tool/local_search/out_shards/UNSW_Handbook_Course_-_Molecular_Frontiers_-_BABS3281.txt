Description
This course focuses on molecular biology techniques commonly used in biomedical research. Using examples from the research performed in the School of BABS, students will gain a practical experience with cloning techniques, Western blotting, genotyping, microarray expression profiling, RNA interference, next-generation sequencing and statistical data analysis. The practical laboratory sessions will be supported by lectures presenting examples of biomedical research in the field of cholesterol metabolism, cancer, drug discovery, protein methylation and long non-coding RNA expression. This course is an excellent opportunity for students to acquire skills essential for successful completion of an Honours project.
