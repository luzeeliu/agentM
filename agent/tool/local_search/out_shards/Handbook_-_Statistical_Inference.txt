Overview
This postgraduate course presents general inference theory based on maximum likelihood and on Bayes methods. Estimation, confidence set construction, and hypothesis testing are discussed within decision-theoretic framework. Computationally intensive methods such as bootstrap are also discussed and are compared to asymptotic approximations such as saddlepoint and empirical likelihood.

Assumed knowledge:
• Calculus
• Linear Algebra
• Probability (at the level of MATH5846 or equivalent)
• Introductory statistics (at the level of MATH5856 or equivalent)
Recommended background:
MATH5905 is a mathematically rigorous course, and it is recommended students have substantial mathematical maturity, as shown by having completed at least 4 mathematics or statistics courses at the third-year undergraduate level or above. Students who do not have this background should contact the course authority for advice before enrolling.
Note: Students who have completed MATH3811 with mark (75+) or MATH3911 with mark (65+) may be exempt from the need to take MATH5905 as a core course in their program.  If an exemption is granted the student may replace MATH5905 by taking an additional elective. Students who have taken one of these courses and received a mark below exemption approval will need support to enrol in the course, contact the School of Mathematics & Statistics for assistance.
