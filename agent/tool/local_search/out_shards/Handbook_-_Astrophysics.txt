This course provides an introduction to astrophysics aimed at students who are taking a Science or Advanced Science degree and majoring in Physics or a physical science, or who want a more challenging, higher level introduction to the subject. The topics covered in this course are the same as PHYS1160, but with an increased quantitative perspective. An additional focus will be provided on the details of the facilities and techniques used in modern astrophysics research. PHYS1116 Astrophysics features more advanced assessment, including a separate problem-solving class.
Topics to be covered include: astronomical techniques, the history of astronomy across cultures, the Big Bang and beginnings of the universe, formation and evolution of galaxies, the origin of life on Earth and search for life elsewhere, stellar structure and evolution, planet formation, black holes, and compact objects.
This course is intended primarily as a technical subject and a pathway into the higher year astrophysics subjects. It has Physics 1A (PHYS1121) as assumed prior knowledge. Students without a background in physics should consider instead PHYS1160 Introduction to Astronomy, which is a standalone course with a broader, more qualitative focus.
