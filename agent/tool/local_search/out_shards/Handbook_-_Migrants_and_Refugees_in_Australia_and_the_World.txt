At a time when much of the world's population is on the move, immigration and asylum have become two of the most contentious issues today. And while Australia's population is one of the most diverse, our society is historically one of the most insular. In this course, you will explore how migration has shaped and transformed Australian politics and society, and how Australia has responded to migrants and refugees at various moments over the past century. We examine the rise and fall of the White Australia policy, the major shifts of the post-war period and new international obligations, Australia's changing attitudes to newcomers, the appearance of "boat people" and new regimes of exclusion, and the ways in which successive migrant groups have come to call Australia home. You will also examine Australia's approach in its global and contemporary contexts.
