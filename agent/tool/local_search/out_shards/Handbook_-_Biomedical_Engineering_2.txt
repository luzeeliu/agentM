Course Substitution
keyboard_arrow_down
A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering. Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
