The Bachelor of Fine Arts (Honours) is a 48 UOC (one year equivalent) advanced undergraduate degree for high achieving students. The program is designed for those who have completed an undergraduate degree in Fine Arts (or cognate area), and wish to extend their critical and creative skills in contemporary art contexts. The BFA (Hons) enables students to advance their knowledge and understanding of artistic practice by developing a significant practice-led research project. Supported by coursework in art theory and professional practice, the program supports students to gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between theory and practice in contemporary art contexts. By doing so, this program can provide pathways to higher degree research programs such as an MFA or PhD, as well as a diverse array of professional and career outcomes in the arts and cultural sectors.
