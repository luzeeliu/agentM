This course is an introductory course in financial management. It stresses the modern fundamentals of corporate financial decision making with special reference to investment, financing and payout decisions. While building upon introductory courses in accounting, economics and quantitative analysis, the course develops distinctive conceptual frameworks and specialised tools for solving real world financial problems at both the project and corporate level. The course is a blend of theory and practice. While diligent practice will make you competent in financial techniques, a good grasp of theory will help you think systematically about ways to solve a problem for which no existing technique is suitable or available.
