This 2nd year chemistry subject develops students’ understanding of Physical Chemistry, which seeks to explain chemical processes in terms of energy changes and the molecular nature of matter. This course introduces quantum mechanics and its role in determining the energy levels of atoms and molecules. The course then introduces the molecular basis underpinning the laws of thermodynamics and their applications in chemistry, with specific attention given to the application of thermodynamics to electrochemical processes. Finally, the course then introduces the physical basis for understanding the factors affecting reaction rates, the role of reaction mechanisms, and molecular theory of reaction rates. Content is delivered through recorded lectures and reinforced through in-person workshops and laboratories.
