Description
Genetics is the study of inheritance and is an exciting and rapidly expanding discipline with applications in medicine, biotechnology, agriculture and many other fields. This course provides an overview of the key concepts in genetics including gene structure and transmission, genetic variation, regulation of gene activity, genetic variation, mutation and evolution. Laboratory experiments and conference-style activities are used to demonstrate genetic theory and its application, and provide an introduction to real-world research in genetics.
Assumed knowledge: CHEM1011 Chemistry A: Atoms, Molecules and Energy or BIOS1101 Evolutionary and Functional Biology.
Note:
