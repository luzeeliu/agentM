This handbook entry is for students commencing their studies from 2024. Please refer to previous editions of the handbook for pre-2024 requirements.
This double degree program offered by the Faculty of Science and UNSW Business School allows students to earn two degrees after five and a half years of successful study: a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering, and a Bachelor of Commerce.
The program is designed for aspiring materials scientists or engineers who want to gain a deeper understanding of the economic and social aspects of their profession, as well as develop skills in technical management and professional leadership. It is expected that students enrolled in this program will advance to entrepreneurial and managerial roles.
A full range of commerce and engineering careers remains available to those who successfully complete both components of this double degree. Many materials scientists and engineers advance into technical management roles, so this double degree program not only strengthens the commerce background but also provides essential engineering skills.
In addition, materials engineers are increasingly finding employment in the commercial sector, and the double degree program serves as a solid foundation for those entering fields such as banking, consultancy, or entrepreneurship. Students aspiring to pursue purely commercial careers will also benefit from the technical and numerate strengths acquired through the engineering program.
