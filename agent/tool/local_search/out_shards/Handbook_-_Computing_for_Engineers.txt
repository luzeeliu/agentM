Computing is an integral part of modern engineering. Computing is used in the design, automation, experimentation, monitoring, diagnosis, data collection, data analysis, visualisation and many other aspects of engineering. A very important skill for engineers is to be able to use computers to help them to solve problems efficiently. The aim of this course is to give an introduction to computing for engineers with an emphasis on computational problem solving. In order to realise this aim, the students will learn to use the Python programming language and some its many packages to solve problems. Since the course is designed primarily for engineers, the computing examples are often presented together with an engineering context to help the students to appreciate the applications of computing in engineering. This course also includes a minor component in Matlab and spreadsheet.
