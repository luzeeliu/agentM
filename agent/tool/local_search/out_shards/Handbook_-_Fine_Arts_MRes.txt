The Master of Fine Arts (Research) program enables students of proven ability to engage in the sustained investigation at an advanced level of an area of interest or concern in their visual arts practice. This inquiry takes the form of a supervised research project and leads to the exhibitions, performance, publication or screening of artwork/s that are complete, coherent and appropriate to the stated inquiry.
The significance of the research outcomes may be the contribution of new knowledge to the fine arts, the innovation of a distinctive methodology or approach in visual arts practice, poetics or the new application of technologies in visual arts practice. The products of the inquiry should be the creation of high quality studio based work accompanied by a written component containing documentation of the project and its development.
MFA(Res) studies are available in the discipline areas of Digital Imaging, Drawing, Film, Installation, Interactive Media, Painting, Performance, Photomedia, Printmaking, Sculpture, Sound, Time-Based Art, Video, Ceramics, Jewellery & Textiles. Studies in a combination of discipline areas are possible. Students work under the guidance of a qualified supervisor who is usually a member of the Faculty's full-time lecturing staff. Regular seminars are held at which MFA candidates are required to give a presentation of their research at least once during their program.
Some individual on-campus studio space is available to MFA students; all general college facilities and equipment may be accessed. Research students are encouraged to take an active part in college life.
