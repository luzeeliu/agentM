Each year the nation commits more than half of its capital outlays to land development, building and infrastructure. The property industry is rapidly moving from essentially responding to client requirements for structures to providing business solutions and sustainable communities. This makes property a key sector of the economy. The UNSW Master of Property and Development (MPD) program is designed to meet the needs of those who wish to work at the cutting edge of these changes and offers a suite of courses that stretch your imagination and capabilities.
The program will appeal to people seeking careers in development, investment and management of property, facilities and infrastructure and the professions that serve this industry. It also provides career pathways for those seeking to broaden their professional skills, such as architects and landscape architects, construction professionals, engineers, urban planners and lawyers.
Fully online mode is only available to domestic students and students not on an international student visa.
