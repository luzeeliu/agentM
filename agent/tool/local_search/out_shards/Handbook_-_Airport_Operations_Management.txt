Airport Operations Management is a fully online, distance education course that provides a broad understanding of the key elements of airport operations so that regardless of the student’s specific personal involvement in aviation, they can take a realistic view of airport operations management, financing, regulation, risk mitigation and community impacts.
This course covers day-to-day operational management items such as managing annual budgets, fees associated with key airport processes and stakeholders, determination methods, emergency planning in all aspects, relationships with airlines, government relations, slot management and airport retail. It also explores other airport business opportunities, aircraft parking control, wider industry engagement, and general administrative tasks at airports such as ground transport, flight information, electricity and water.
Through bespoke educational videos and resources, and opportunities to engage in consultation and drop-in sessions with an airport operations expert, students are provided with key insights and advice on how to prepare for success as an airport operations manager.
