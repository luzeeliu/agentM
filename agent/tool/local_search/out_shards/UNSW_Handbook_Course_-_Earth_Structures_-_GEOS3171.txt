Description
Most regions of the Earth's crust have been deformed over many millions of years, resulting in a complex three dimensional form. This course seeks to unravel this history through use of remotely sensed geophysical imagery and field mapping data. This course will demonstrate how large scale regional structures are inferred or measures from surface outcrop mapping.
Note:
A five day field mapping camp is an essential part of the course and will involve some cost to students.
