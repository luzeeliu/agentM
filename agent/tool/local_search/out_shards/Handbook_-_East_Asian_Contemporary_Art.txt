This course provides a critical introduction to contemporary art in and from East Asia. It focuses particularly on art from mainland China, Japan, and South Korea, from the mid-twentieth century to the present. Contemporary art in and from East Asia is characterised by intersections between local and western(ised) cultural thinking and practice. This course will enable students to develop understandings of the varied historical, cultural, political, and social conditions that have shaped contemporary art’s development in East Asia as well as its relationships to the international art world. Exploring how contemporary artists deploy materials, techniques, and conventions from East Asian artistic traditions, this course will enable students to critically reflect on the concepts of ‘tradition’, ‘modernity’, and ‘contemporaneity’ as they are used in contemporary art discourses. Examining how contemporary art from East Asia has been discussed, theorised, and displayed in different local and international contexts, this course will encourage multiple critical interventions into international and localised perspectives on contemporary artistic theory and practice.
