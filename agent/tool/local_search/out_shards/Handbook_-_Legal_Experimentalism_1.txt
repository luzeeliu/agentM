The Legal Experimentalism course aims to equip law students to employ legal skills and knowledge in innovative, creative ways. The course will do so by combining two main elements. First, it offers students a firm grounding in the legal traditions of Legal Realism and their contemporary derivations. Second, it affords students opportunities to engage collaboratively in the creative rewriting and redeployment of legal instruments, texts and institutions and/or to start to think through the potential development of new legal technologies and institutions.
