How do investors decide if a property is a solid opportunity or a financial trap? What drives the pricing of mortgages, and how are they packaged and traded in global markets? Can real estate finance help solve or does it worsen housing affordability challenges? FINS3633 Real Estate Finance equips students with the analytical tools, financial models, and industry insight needed to navigate this high-stakes sector. You’ll explore how residential and commercial properties are financed, valued, and traded, and learn how real estate fits into the broader financial system. Key topics include mortgage design and pricing, commercial property valuation, real estate investment trusts (REITs), the secondary mortgage market, and mortgage-backed securities. You'll also examine how regulation, sustainability, and policy influence investment decisions and market behaviour. Drawing on case studies, from Australian auctions to international property trends, and insights from guest industry speakers, the course prepares students to make evidence-based recommendations in complex real estate contexts. This course is ideal for students pursuing careers in real estate investment, development, banking, or public policy, and who want to understand property finance not just as a set of tools, but as a lens on how economies grow, change, and house their people.
