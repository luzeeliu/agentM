The Security and Defence MBAX Specialisation is designed as a unique educational pathway to develop well informed, highly skilled, and future-ready professionals in defence, government, and related occupations. The specialisation works in partnership with the PLuS Alliance (UNSW, King’s College London and Arizona State University), to draw on well-established UNSW Canberra Master programs which have a strong alignment with the defence sector: the Master of Strategy and Security and Master of War Studies. As a student, you will gain an integrated understanding of current and emerging defence and security policy such as the AUKUS agreement and of challenges such as disruptive technologies. With a focus on international collaboration, the specialisation will equip you with advanced skills in strategic analysis, security policy, and military studies.
