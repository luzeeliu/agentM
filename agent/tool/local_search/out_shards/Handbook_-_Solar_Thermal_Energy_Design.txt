Solar thermal energy is created when radiation from the sun is either directly or indirectly (via electricity or a chemical intermediaries) converted to heat for applications in the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors. This course will give you an engineering perspective of the solar technologies we use for these demands. The first section of the course deals with the characteristics of sunlight, along with some methods of analysis and measurement of solar radiation. The second section of the course covers the working principles of solar thermal technologies (ranging from low to high cost), introducing the general tools necessary to analyze heat and mass transfer within these devices. Lastly, we will cover how these technologies can be integrated into systems including control, circulation, and storage. The content reflects the experience of the lecturer/demonstrators/guests in the research, development, and installation of these systems.
It should be noted that the course deliberately stays away from photovoltaics (for which UNSW has several advanced courses) and instead focuses on the conversion and use of solar energy as
heat
