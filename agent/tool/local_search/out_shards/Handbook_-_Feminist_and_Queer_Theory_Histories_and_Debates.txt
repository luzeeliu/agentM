This course offers an interdisciplinary survey of key thinkers, debates and developments in feminist and queer theory, in the Anglophone world and beyond it. You will have the opportunity to engage closely and critically with the ideas of influential scholars such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Sara Ahmed, Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, as well as innovative thinkers whose work deserves to be more widely known. We will consider the overlaps and differences between feminist and queer theories and their emergence as part of, and in response, to social movements. You will also be encouraged to make connections between feminist and queer theories and critical race theory, trans studies and Indigenous feminisms. Above all, this course aims to demonstrate the ongoing relevance of feminist and queer theory to gender studies and to the wider world we live in.
