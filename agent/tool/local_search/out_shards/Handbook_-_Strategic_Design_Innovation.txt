Over the last three decades design innovation has become strategic: success in design requires a strategy for managing the broader problems of innovation. As design has gained importance, it also has become relevant to a wide array of stakeholders. This has added complexity to the way in which design should be undertaken.
Design is an important instrument of innovation in manufacturing and service industries, as well as in public, semi-public and humanitarian organisations. These environments set many types of requirements for innovation, including price points, brand requirements, competition, technological and brand legacies, government regulations, and ethics. They almost always require an analysis of the ethical environment, which is often but not always coded into professional rules and regulations.
These environments are usually ambiguous, dynamic and reactive, and designers cannot control them. To innovate in these environments, designers need strategies for identifying and managing these contextual requirements.
DESN3000 teaches you skills in strategic design innovation. These include: skills for capturing the boundary conditions that create conditions for innovation; skills for creating design concepts that provide a fit to the strategic environment; skills for creating innovation strategies that help them to innovate in with multiple stakeholders who often have conflicting values and shifting interests; skills for identifying ethical problems involved in design decisions; and skills for managing teams and projects in strategic context.
