Music Craft 3 is one of three Level 1 courses in music performance, composition, and creation. You will work closely with your private teacher (in subsidised lessons) to create and perform a short project in your selected musical field. A further focus in class will be on understanding and developing skills in music improvisation. These skills will be transferrable to performance, composition, music production and pedagogic practice. This will further expand possibilities for future engagement and collaboration, and open new creative opportunities in today’s diverse, multi-faceted, musical world.  You will also develop your skills in collaborative performance through participation in a university-based performing ensemble. You will interact with leading Australian and international music makers in a curated series of masterclasses.
