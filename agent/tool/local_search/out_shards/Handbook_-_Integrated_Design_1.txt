This specialisation is for students commencing from 2026.
The Integrated Design specialisation in the Bachelor of Design provides a studio based, critical, research-led education in the overarching discipline of design. We produce graduates who are both versatile and adventurous. The specialisation builds on UNSW Art & Design's strengths in equipping graduates with a commitment to material quality coupled with critical idealism. The 3-year specialisation emphasises a distinctive understanding of how design can change our societies, grounded in a deep reflection on diverse historical, social and cultural values. Graduates of Integrated Design understand how design-led solutions assist people to perform at their best in agile and rapidly changing environments. We also ensure that the futures that they co-design are diverse and sustainable for all peoples. The merging of making, criticality, technology, research, management and business provides graduates with transferable skills for careers across a range of existing and emerging design fields.
