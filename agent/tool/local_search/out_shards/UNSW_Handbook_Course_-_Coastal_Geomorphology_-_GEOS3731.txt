Description
This course provides a lecture and field-based study of the processes responsible for shaping and modifying Australian and global coastal environments. The foundation of the course  is an application of the morphodynamic approach to understanding coastal environments. Topics covered include coastal evolution, nearshore waves, currents and sediment transport, beaches and other coastal environments, and coastal hazards and management. A strong emphasis is placed on practical applications related to coastal monitoring techniques. Fieldwork is an important component of the course and an optional 3-4 day fieldtrip will involve expense to individual students.
