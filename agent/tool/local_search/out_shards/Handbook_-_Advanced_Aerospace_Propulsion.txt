This is a continuation of AERO3660 Flight Performance and Propulsion looking at advanced aspects of propulsion. It further builds on MMAN2700 Thermodynamics.
We start by conduction, convection, and radiation modes of heat transfer as our more advanced propulsion systems will require cooling. In detail, we look into a more detailed heat exchanger analysis than what was done in MMAN2700 Thermodynamics and we consider the Meredith effect.
We take the basic analysis of the turbojet engine and extend it to analyse the two-spool turbofan gas turbine engine. We also analyse propelling nozzles suitable for commercial and military aircraft. We also have a detailed look at Ramjets and Scramjets.
The work on rocketry is new. You will be introduced to rocket engines and rocket nozzle performance. To aid in our understanding we consider high temperature gas analysis, van der Waals equation of state and other more advanced equations of state.We pay a lot of attention to liquid rocket combustion, the prediction of adiabatic flame temperature of high-temperature reacting systems, the effects of chemical equilibrium on the adiabatic flame temperature. We also consider the burning regimes of solid rocket boosters.
To complete the work on rocketry, we consider electrothermal thrusters, , nuclear rockets, ion thrusters and their optimization.
Today, electrification and partial electrification of aircraft is gaining in importance. We consider hybrid powertrains, batteries, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system analysis, electric machines (motors), boost converters for aircraft. We also take into account energy harvesting, the Betz limit, the Peukert effect, Paschen's law.
To finish up, we consider exergy analysis, internal combustion engines, and turbulent jet ignition.
