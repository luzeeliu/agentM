This course equips students with the advanced tools and frameworks necessary to finance, scale, and strategically exit high-growth ventures. Moving beyond early-stage ideation, it delves into later-stage entrepreneurial financing, covering growth equity, venture debt, IPO preparation, mergers & acquisitions, and private equity buyouts. Students will learn to model venture cash flows under uncertainty, design optimal capital structures, manage investor relations, and evaluate exit pathways from both entrepreneurial and investor perspectives. The course combines rigorous financial analysis with practical strategy, preparing students to make high-stakes decisions as founders, CFOs, venture partners, or strategic consultants. No prior advanced finance required as we build your capability step by step.
