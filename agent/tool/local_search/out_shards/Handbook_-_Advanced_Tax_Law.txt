This course dives deep into the income tax considerations for the primary entities utilised in Australia's closely held sector for business operations and asset holdings: sole traders, partnerships, trusts, and companies. With a vast amount of commerce and asset ownership channelled through these entities, a pivotal focus is on the real-world decision of entity selection for asset owners and entrepreneurs. You will explore both the relevant tax and critical non-tax (general law) considerations influencing these decisions.
Emphasising practical scenarios, the course not only covers the technical tax rules and their applications but also addresses the key general law factors involved. To enhance your analytical and leadership abilities, the course includes opportunities to critique peer work, participate in discussions, and reflect systematically on your own contributions.
Beyond the technicalities, you are encouraged to engage with a broader theme: understanding how tax regulations result in varied outcomes depending on the chosen entity. This approach ensures a comprehensive grasp of the material, preparing you for informed decision-making in the professional realm.
