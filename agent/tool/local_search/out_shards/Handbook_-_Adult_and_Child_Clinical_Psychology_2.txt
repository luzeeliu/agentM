Consistent with PSYC7212, this course provides theoretical knowledge and practical skills in child and adult clinical psychology for candidates undertaking postgraduate training in clinical psychology. The focus is on aetiology, assessment, diagnosis, case conceptualisation, and empirically-supported treatment of clinical disorders across the lifespan. These problems will be considered within the individual client’s relevant sociocultural context, with consideration given to providing culturally-responsive approaches to clinical care and collaboration with other professionals if indicated. The course is guided by a scientist-practitioner approach and covers best practice guidelines, with particular emphasis on consideration of our professional obligation to conduct safe and ethical practice and to protect the public while delivering evidence-based clinical services. The teaching activities include lectures, interactive activities (e.g., group discussions, role-plays), and self-guided online modules. Individual lecturers may assign readings that should be completed prior to the lecture.
