In this Honours course, students will be provided with a solid foundation needed to understand relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, the standard model, and quantum information and computation. Through a series of lectures, students will explore topics such as : The spin-statistics relationship; second quantisation; angular momentum; the density matrix; relaxation and decoherence; the Klein-Gordon equation; the Dirac equation; second quantisation of the Dirac field.
Students who are approved for Honours will need to enrol in this course in as part of their Honours program, alongside PHYS4142.
This course constitutes 6 UoC out of a total of 24 UoC of coursework in the Physics Honours structure. There is also a total of 24 UoC of Honours research project work to be completed over the year.
