This course examines the foreign and defense policies of the world’s major powers, including the United States and China, from 1945 to the present. It focuses on their competing visions of global and regional order and their strategies for achieving them. It highlights how these competing visions often resulted in disagreements, occasionally leading to wars and proxy conflicts among major powers. In this context, it discusses how these powers defined their national interests and articulated their geopolitical and security concerns. It also analyses the geopolitical, military, economic and domestic constraints under which these powers operated and the economic and military means they relied upon to achieve their visions of global and regional order. In other words, POLS5129 considers the various factors that have influenced their diplomatic and military approaches to international politics, including threat perceptions, ideological considerations, military and economic capabilities, as well as geopolitical and strategic constraints. You will examine the key political, economic and military developments that have shaped contemporary world politics from the second half of the 20th century to the first three decades of the new century. This course is specifically designed for postgraduate students interested in contemporary diplomacy, geopolitics, and statecraft, who seek to understand how the world’s major powers have pursued their national interests in a complex post-war international system.
