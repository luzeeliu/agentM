This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Public Relations and Advertising Principles in an Australian and international context. You will examine the history, growth, and contemporary influence of both disciplines. The foundations of PR and advertising are studied, as are their influence within and outside organisations, and the linkages both disciplines have in the “communications mix”. You will be able to understand the similarity and difference between PR and advertising in relation to communication strategy, research, media relations, industry, and professional pathways. You will also gain an appreciation of the ethical dimensions and issues in allied communication disciplines.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
