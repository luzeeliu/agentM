Description
The course will build on the information gained in PHAR2011 and PHAR3102 in relation to the business of drug development, from lead discovery to final drug registration. It will present drug development as a process involving biochemical target selection, lead discovery using structure-based methods and combinatorial chemistry/high-throughput screening. Safety evaluation, bioavailability, clinical trials, and the essentials of patent law will also be discussed. Along the way you will learn about molecular recognition, computer-based drug design, and toxicology as applied to the development of new medicines.
