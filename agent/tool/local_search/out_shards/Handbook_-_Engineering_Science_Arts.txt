Overview
The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Arts (3732) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Arts (3961) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree. The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides… For more content click the Read More button below.
The dual Bachelor of Engineering Science/Bachelor of Arts (3732) is a 4-year non-accredited pass degree that also serves as an exit degree for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons)/Bachelor of Arts (3961) program. As such, students cannot generally request a transfer into this exit degree.
The Bachelor of Engineering Science provides graduates with a grounding in a specific engineering discipline, as well as foundational knowledge in the underlying theories and sciences that provides the basis for engineering. It provides graduates with technical skills and confidence to analyse and apply their knowledge to solve engineering problems. Graduates will also be able to think in terms of systems and complex interactions and be capable of contributing effectively in teams.
The Bachelor of Arts (UNSW BA) is designed to provide you with all the benefits of an education in the Humanities, Social Sciences and the Creative and Performing Arts. The degree is flexible so that you can structure it around your skills, interests and career aspirations. The program has both breadth, allowing you to try out and explore different areas of interest, and depth, allowing you to focus in detail on two areas of specialisation.

Students must complete 192 UOC.
Bachelor of Engineering Science (96 UOC)
96 UOC Engineering Science major
Bachelor of Arts (96 UOC)
A Major specialisation (48 UOC)
A Minor specialisation (36 UOC)
Prescribed Electives (12 UOC)

A Major specialisation (48 UOC)
A second Major specialisation (48 UOC)
In this dual degree students take 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering Science, and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Arts, for a total of 192 UOC. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 192 UOC (e.g. if mathematics is taken as the minor stream in the BA component), students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 192 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.

The Engineering Science specialisation component requires completion of 96 UOC of Engineering courses, chosen from those listed in the relevant BE (Hons) discipline specialisation.
At least 24 UOC of these courses must be from Level 3 or above.
Course substitution

A student may be able to substitute a maximum of 12 UOC of core courses subject to the approval of their School and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs) of the Faculty of Engineering.
Students who have transferred to 3706 from a single or dual Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) may count courses not listed here towards the requirements of their major if they are considered equivalent or have been superceded by other courses. This is only possible if the course(s) were listed in the handbook for their Engineering major, and they are completing an Engineering Science major in the same discipline.
