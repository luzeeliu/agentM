The course provides an understanding of the various definitions of leadership and how they intersect, influence and are shaped by the cultural and creative industries. Leadership is examined from a theoretical and real word perspective to provide you with knowledge and practical techniques to help shape your careers. The idea of leadership takes many forms as distinct from organisational hierarchy, role or status. Cultural leadership is reflected in and by the organisation and industry, and this course demonstrates the interconnectedness of leadership to other disciplines such as marketing, writing, management, creative practice and production. Through lectures, workshops, case studies and action learning you will engage with examples of leadership in cultural and creative organisations, reflect on your own understanding of leadership and develop your own leadership capacity, preparing you for the rapidly evolving cultural landscape.
