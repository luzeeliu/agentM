Software Engineering is an Engineering profession concerned with the processes, methods, and tools for the design and development of high quality, reliable software systems. This involves the study and application of software specification, design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software. Target systems may range from simple software applications to mission-critical real-time systems.
Software Engineering is studied as a stream in the BE(Hons). Day to day administration of this stream is conducted through the Computer Science and Engineering Student Office.
This page outlines the core rules for the Software Engineering stream when taken as part of a single or dual award. The requirements total 168 units of credit, plus 60 days of industrial training. Refer to the program page for full details on the overall program requirements.
Further details on the stream requirements, electives, and advice regarding the order and placement of courses in the stream can be found at the:
