This specialisation is currently only offered on a full-time basis with commencement in Term 1 each year.
The Accounting Honours program is a one-year program designed for high-achieving undergraduate students who want to deepen their accounting expertise, develop strong analytical skills, and enhance their career prospects. Students are exposed to a range of accounting research disciplines and are supported by faculty experts to develop the skills to design and conduct an independent research project and produce an Honours thesis.
With smaller class sizes than pass groups, the program provides students with a uniquely collaborative and intellectually stimulating environment. Students can expect to engage with advanced accounting concepts, explore emerging challenges in financial management, and critically assess how accounting evolves in response to technological, economic, and regulatory changes.
During the program Honours students will refine their ability to think independently, evaluate complex information, and contribute meaningfully to discussions on the future of accounting. These skills are highly valued across the profession, and an Honours degree provides a distinct advantage for those considering careers in accounting, consulting, public policy or academia.
