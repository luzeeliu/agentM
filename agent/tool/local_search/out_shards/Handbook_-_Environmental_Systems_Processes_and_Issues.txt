Understanding how different environmental processes influence atmospheric and physical systems is crucial for understanding many environmental issues and is essential knowledge for careers in environmental science and related fields. This course covers a range of topics including climate and weather, landscape and soil evolution, hydrology, and rivers and coasts – both from global and Australian perspectives. Key environmental issues discussed include climate change and storms, land degradation, water resources and pollution, flooding and coastal erosion and natural hazards. A major theme of the course is the interaction of humans with the environment and the causes of environmental problems and hazards. The course has a reputation for engaging lectures, uses innovative and interactive practical labs that are often held outdoors to enhance an appreciation of a range of environments and issues. This course is well suited to any student interested in the physical environment and/or who are studying Geography, Environmental Science and Environmental Management.
