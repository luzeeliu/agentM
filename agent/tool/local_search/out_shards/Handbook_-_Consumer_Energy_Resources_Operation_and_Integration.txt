Australia is leading the way in adopting rooftop solar—and are now seeing rapid uptake of batteries, and electric vehicles—technologies known as Consumer Energy Resources (CER). These systems are changing how we produce, use, and manage electricity.
In this course, you will explore how CER technologies work and how they connect to the broader electricity grid and energy markets. You will work with real-world data to understand and optimise CER performance for homes, businesses, and networks.
You will learn to use data-science tools to analyse large datasets, model CER operations, and evaluate their economic and environmental value. You will also gain insight into the key Australian standards and regulations that govern CER deployment.
Through industry-inspired projects, you will develop your ability to solve complex, open-ended problems—just like in professional CER roles in industry. This course is ideal if you want to apply your coding and analytical skills to real energy challenges and be part of Australia’s clean energy future.
