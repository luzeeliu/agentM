The Graduate Diploma in Legal Professional Practice (GDLPP) is an accredited practical legal training program for law graduates to meet the practical training requirements for admission to the New South Wales legal profession under the Legal Profession Uniform Admission Rules 2015.
Students must complete 42 units of credit for the GDLPP. The program consists of core and optional components. Each component is equivalent to 6 units of credit. The core components are Skills in Practice; Values in Practice; Litigation Practice; Transactional Practice; and Workplace Experience 1. The prescribed elective courses are Administrative Law Practice; Banking and Finance; Consumer Law Practice; Criminal Law Practice; Family Law Practice; Employment and Industrial Relations Practice; Planning and Environmental Law Practice; and Wills and Estates Practice. Students must choose and complete two of these eight electives (each elective course is worth 3 units of credit).
To complete the program, students must choose one of the optional components: Workplace Experience 2 OR the Practicum.
Workplace Experience 1 and 2 each require a minimum 20 days work experience placement as supervised employment in a legal office or supervised paid or unpaid placement in a law or law-related work environment.
The Practicum involves areas of innovation and technology, adaptive lawyering, or specialised social justice, through a combination of placement; simulated workplaces; technical learning spaces; law-related projects; continuing legal education; and structured reflective practice. The Practicum may involve acquiring additional specialised experience, skills, and knowledge with the guidance of UNSW​ PLT and students are responsible for contributing to the design of their Practicum, in consultation with UNSW PLT.
The full-time GDLPP 20-week coursework component commences with a compulsory 5-day onsite intensive that is followed by online courses. Students complete the Workplace Experience and Practicum components in their own time – however, the entire program must be completed within 2 years of commencement of the coursework component.
