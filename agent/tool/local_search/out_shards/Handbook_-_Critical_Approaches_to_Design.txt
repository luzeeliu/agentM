This course builds upon your knowledge of design as a practice for addressing social and environmental issues. You will build knowledge and understanding of design problems through evaluation and analysis of an existing real-world scenario, and produce a critical design response. You will engage with a range of human-centred research methodologies that will aid in your selection and analysis of a design problem. You will use human-centred design methodologies to develop innovative, informed and often unexpected design solutions that challenge conventions and assumptions. This course fosters the development of a peer mentoring culture through collaborative research, iteration, interdisciplinary collaboration and critique.
