This course suits individuals looking to build their strategic abilities around entrepreneurship and the innovation associated with entrepreneurship. It provides exposure to both the fundamentals of business innovation and the practical aspects of identifying, evaluating and moving business ideas forward. The course uniquely exposes current students with current ideas and thoughts from innovators, venture capital (VC) groups, and successful startup CEOs within the Sydney ecosystem.
This dynamic course pulls together many of the components already learned in the MBA Program, providing those with entrepreneurial aspirations the opportunity to realise their dreams.
Two streams of entrepreneurship are covered in the course: startup creation and startup innovation. Specific methodologies covered include integrated experiences of Design Thinking and The Lean Startup.
This is a hands-on opportunity to learn about venture creation, startup resourcing, strategy and management, design and innovation involving your own startup. Entrepreneurship and innovation is a hot topic today – many startups continue to raise money through angel investors and VCs, but the road is a challenging one.
Understanding what makes entrepreneurship and innovation in startups work is paramount to success. We will help you develop your confidence, your products, your pitch, and your funding to help get you started on the road to your startup success.
