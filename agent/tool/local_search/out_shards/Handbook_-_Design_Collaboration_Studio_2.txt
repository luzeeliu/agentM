Design Collaboration Studio 2 is the intermediate studio for the Bachelor of Design program and its three specialisations: Integrated Design, Industrial Design, and Computational Design. In this studio, you will deepen your understanding of how you can contribute to addressing complex, real-world challenges. Each class is delivered within a single specialisation, but all students will respond to a shared design brief grounded in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The course encourages critical thinking, creativity, and a research-informed approach to developing design responses that are both socially and environmentally responsible. You will work both independently and in teams to develop and prototype future-focused design outcomes using the UNSW Makerspace Network or equivalent facilities. Peer collaboration and feedback will be emphasised within your specialisation, while the broader course framework supports an appreciation of how different designers approach shared challenges.
