The Graduate Diploma in Mining Engineering offers foundational knowledge and practical skills for professionals already working in the mining sector or individuals looking to transition into the industry. This postgraduate qualification is designed for those who want to advance their expertise in mining engineering while continuing their current professional roles.
The Graduate Diploma in Mining Engineering will be awarded after successful completion of 48 Units of Credit (UOC). The program can be undertaken either full-time or part-time, providing flexibility to accommodate the schedules of working professionals. Most courses are delivered in a modular format, either face-to-face or online, in intensive block periods. This delivery mode is particularly well-suited for employees of mining companies and associated service providers, allowing them to balance their studies with their work commitments.
The curriculum covers a broad range of essential mining engineering topics, from mine design and process optimization to safety and environmental management. Students will gain a solid understanding of both the technical and managerial aspects of the mining industry, while also developing critical research skills that will prepare them for leadership roles. The program provides a comprehensive overview of the field, making it an ideal option for professionals who wish to specialize in mining engineering without committing to a full Master's degree.
This qualification not only enhances career prospects but also serves as an excellent pathway for those wishing to further their education, with the option to continue into the Master of Mining Engineering if desired.
NOTE:
Some electives may only be offered every two years.
Courses are offered in intensive block mode or fully distance. Students should contact the school on mere.admin@unsw.edu.au for a copy of the latest MINE PG Coursework Calendar.
International students on a student visa are required to study no more than one third of the program online.
