Food Science and Technology
Description
Food Science and Technology involves the understanding of basic sciences and the application of this knowledge to foods from the point of production, through handling, processing, preservation, distribution and marketing, up to consumption and utilisation by consumers. It is concerned with food processes, food commodities, food composition and food quality (including sensory properties, safety and nutritional value).
The food scientist and food technologist are concerned with food supplies and requirements, community wants and needs, and equitable distribution of foods to ensure human nutritional needs are met. Graduates find employment within the food industry, the public sector, education, research, the food service industry, public health, management and marketing, health and environmental sciences, and in areas such as dietetics after further training.
