You will be introduced to the history of the Nazi destruction of the European Jews during the Second World War. You will analyse the origins and implementation of Nazi anti-Jewish policies, the ways in which the civilian population responded to state-sponsored violence, and developments during the so-called Aftermath of the Holocaust. You will predominantly focus on an intensive study of the Holocaust, and will debate diverse perspectives on perpetrators, victims and bystanders. In the course you will also deal with other cases of mass violence committed by Nazi Germany (Slavs, religious minorities, physically and mentally disabled, and homosexuals) and will have the opportunity in your assessments to examine the Holocaust in relation to other acts of genocide committed during the twentieth century (Armenian genocide, Cambodia, Yugoslavia and Rwanda).
