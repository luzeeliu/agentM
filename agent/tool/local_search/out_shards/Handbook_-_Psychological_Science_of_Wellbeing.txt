This course will introduce you to evidence-based strategies for self-management capacity. Self-management is the capacity to work effectively toward meaningful goals, and to be flexible in the face of setbacks. The rationale for this course is that self-management skills constitute a type of graduate capability that, in theory, should help you survive the stressors of university life, but also help you to thrive (i.e., do well) in many aspects of your personal and professional life at university and beyond. In this course we will introduce you to the theories and research relevant to topics such as stress, well-being, motivation, emotional regulation, common barriers to achieving, metacognitive strategies, study strategies, and working/living with others. The topic will emphasise real-life applications of psychology, such as the capacity to self-reflect (e.g., understand when new material has or has not been sufficiently learned) and strategies to minimise dysfunctional stress. You will be given many opportunities to acquire skills related to these topics, and this should help you to acquire the knowledge necessary for the assessments. Although the course draws on principles of psychological science, you do not need any formal knowledge of science or scientific terms.
