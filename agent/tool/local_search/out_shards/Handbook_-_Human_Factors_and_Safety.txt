Understanding human factors and safety holistically is key for designing well-considered work systems that can mitigate the risk of human failures by taking the abilities and limitations of humans into account. In a time where the aviation industry is undergoing a "technological renaissance" with the introduction of emerging technologies and initiatives, there is an ever-increasing need for aviation managers with a deep and current understanding of safety management systems to ensure safe handling and operations of aircraft, airspace and people working within these systems.
In the Human Factors and Safety 24 UoC specialisation, students will learn key skills and knowledge essential for effectively managing safety in aviation and other contexts. Students will undertake core courses in aviation human factors and safety management systems. They will also have the opportunity to take courses exploring the concepts of aviation law and regulation, aviation and security, accident investigation, sustainable and advanced aviation, aviation policy and safety risk management. Together the 24 UoC of specialised courses will equip students with a specialised toolkit to undertake the wide range of day-to-day airport management tasks and decision-making necessary for the effective management of human factors and safety.
The

specialisation is available to students enrolled in the Master of Aviation Management program. It designed for students who have a particular interest in human factors and safety and/or would like to embark on a career as a human factors and safety specialist.
