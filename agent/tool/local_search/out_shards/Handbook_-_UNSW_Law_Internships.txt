Work Integrated Learning (WIL) provides students with an opportunity to gain professional experience in an area of law and to prepare for a future legal career.
During the internship students develop legal and professional skills such as research, writing, legal assistance for clients, advocacy, and related activities through real world practice, and critically analyse the operation of the law, policy, and the legal system in Australia. This course aims to provide students with real world legal experience, increase employability skills, and provide a foundation to embark on a successful graduate legal career.
Students can apply for an internship with Faculty WIL partners, or to self-source an internship with a law practice that aligns with their interests. For further information go to

At the Host Organisation
Students work under the supervision of a solicitor within a host organisation for a minimum of 70 hours (10 days). The work tasks are determined by the host organisation, and generally include research, projects, advocacy, preparing case summaries, briefing papers, liaising with other organisations, and doing relevant work of a substantive nature.
Course Work
The internship placement is complemented with small informal classes which provide a supportive environment to share experiences and challenges arising from the internships. Through peer learning and self-reflection, students are invited to align career pathways with personal aspirations and values, and plan for a future career.
This is a non-graded course (satisfactory/ not satisfactory). Students must attain a grade of satisfactory in each assessment item to achieve a satisfactory for the course overall.
