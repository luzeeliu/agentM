Unlock the power of nuclear technology with a specialisation that prepares you for one of the most advanced and safety-critical fields in engineering. This program equips you with the expertise to safely operate, manage, and design nuclear systems while upholding the highest standards of nuclear safety, security, and safeguards.
The mindset, the physics, and the management tools you will learn in the context of nuclear technology can be applied to a wide range of careers that involve complex interaction between technical risks, regulatory and legal factors and safety critical technology.
You will gain a deep technical understanding of the physics within a reactor, radiation interactions with matter, and the cradle-to-grave of nuclear fuel cycles. This will be taught alongside the essential regulatory, ethical, and risk management frameworks that govern the industry. Through hands-on simulations, case studies, and industry-aligned projects, you will develop the technical and leadership skills required to navigate complex nuclear challenges.
This specialisation is designed for engineers who aspire to work in nuclear energy, defence, medicine, research or regulation. You will learn from leading experts and engage with cutting-edge technologies, ensuring you are prepared with a nuclear mindset to contribute to the safe, sustainable, and responsible use of nuclear technology.
If you are driven by excellence, precision, and a commitment to safety, this program will empower you to make a lasting impact in a globally significant field.
The Nuclear Engineering specialisation will be seeking provisional accreditation with Engineers Australia at the level of Professional Engineer in 2026.
