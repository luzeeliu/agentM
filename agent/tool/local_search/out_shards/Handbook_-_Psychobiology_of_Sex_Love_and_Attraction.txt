If your social media feed has been inundated recently with strange ideas about love and sex, you're not alone. Dramatic societal changes in the last few decades have led to a re-examination of social norms, and many people are questioning how these changes are impacting our romantic relationships and our identities.
In this course, we will use evidence from the fields of evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and biology to gain a better understanding of the fundamental forces that shape sex, love, and attraction.  Through a series of fascinating (and at times disturbing) lectures, this course will provide the tools you need to engage in frank and informed conversations about some of life's greatest questions. Are humans actually monogamous? Why is society obsessed with female chastity? Is masculinity in crisis? How do scientific discoveries get distorted in popular media? And what's the deal with the female orgasm??
This is a 100% online course using pre-recorded lectures*, online modules, and interactive forums. However, we are making some big content adjustments in 2024 to keep up to date with all the latest (and weirdest) research about sex, relationships, and society. Active participation is strongly encouraged, and you will have plenty of opportunities to engage with your peers and lecturers via discussion forums and optional live chats in the Virtual Classroom.
No prior science or psychology knowledge is assumed; the content in this course is accessible to both science students and those in non-science programs.
*Accessibility Note: English subtitles are now available for all lectures. Transcripts upon request.
