Overview
BIOC2101 aims to introduce students to modern biochemistry with an emphasis on how we, as humans, convert foods to useful energy. Major topics covered include proteins and enzymes, carbohydrate catabolism/storage, bioenergetics, protein catabolism, fat metabolism/storage, and the overall integration of these processes and pathways in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.

BIOC2101 aims to introduce students to modern biochemistry with an emphasis on how we, as humans, convert foods to useful energy. Major topics covered include proteins and enzymes, carbohydrate catabolism/storage, bioenergetics, protein catabolism, fat metabolism/storage, and the overall integration of these processes and pathways in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. This course provides a solid context for new learning material by providing clinical, medical, and everyday applications that correspond to the central themes and topics. Practical classes are designed to complement the core biochemical concepts covered in lectures and introduce students to current laboratory techniques and biochemical assays.
