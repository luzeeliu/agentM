The Social Work Professional Doctorate (PrDoc) is a postgraduate research degree available for social workers. It provides the opportunity to combine postgraduate coursework study directly related to an area of advanced social work practice with doctoral research that builds social work knowledge, leading to the presentation of a doctoral thesis. The degree consists of one-third coursework (equivalent to one year full-time, Year 1) and two-thirds research (equivalent to two years full-time, Years 2 and 3). The length of the doctoral thesis is typically 50,000-60,000 words. There is a choice of specialised coursework study in three programs offered by the School of Social Sciences: the Master of Counselling Social Work (8930), the Master of Development Studies (8942), and the Master of Public Policy and Governance (8259).
Advanced professional practice in the discipline of social work involves the continuous development of knowledge for practice. Leadership in social work requires experience, in-depth advanced practice study and sophisticated research skills.
In this program, in-depth advanced practice study is achieved in the specialised coursework component, which builds on foundational social work education and the experience gained through professional practice. This advanced practice study provides the basis for a contribution to social work knowledge through empirical or conceptual research. The thesis study component of the program develops the sophisticated research skills necessary for an original and significant contribution to social work knowledge. The Social Work (PrDoc) program as a whole prepares experienced practitioners for research and practice leadership in the discipline of social work. See
UNSW Higher Degree Research Learning Outcomes
.
Program Structure
The Social Work (PrDoc) is designed as a three year full-time equivalent program, structured as one-third coursework (equivalent to one year full-time, Year 1) and two-thirds research (equivalent to two years full-time, Years 2 and 3). The coursework must be completed prior to the thesis research study. The 48 UOC coursework will be taken within the Master of Counselling Social Work OR the Master of Development Studies OR the Master of Public Policy and Governance. The program of study should be approved by the relevant Masters Convenor and the Social Work (PrDoc) Program Convenor. In the research component, which is 96 UOC, students undertake supervised research leading to the production of a thesis.
Enrolment in the coursework component is part-time for coursework in the Master of Counselling Social Work (this program is not available on a full-time basis), and may be completed part-time or full-time for coursework within the Master of Development Studies or the Master of Public Policy and Governance. Enrolment in the thesis component may be part-time or full-time.
