The Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering offer a dual degree program leading to the award of the degrees Bachelor of Science (Advanced Mathematics)(Honours) and Bachelor of Science (Computer Science). The typical duration of this program is 5 years full-time.
The Advanced Mathematics (Honours) and Computer Science degrees lend themselves well to each other. While the Advanced Mathematics (Honours) degree focuses on an in-depth understanding of pure and applied mathematics, the computer science degree looks at the design, construction and uses of computer systems. Your mathematics study will assist with the manipulation of data as well as the development of algorithms in computer science. There is no better degree to combine your passion for mathematics as well as computer systems.

Double Degree Structure
Students must complete 240 UOC.
Bachelor of Advanced Mathematics (Honours) (144 UOC)
An approved Advanced Mathematics (Honours) major; and
SCIF1131;
48 units of credit Honours Year; and
Science elective courses
Bachelor of Science (Computer Science) (96 UOC)
A Bachelor of Computer Science major; and
Computer Science elective courses
In this dual degree students take 144 UOC for the Bachelor of Advanced Mathematics, and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Science (Computer Science), for a total of 240 UOC. The Science courses required for both degrees can overlap. Depending on the chosen combination of Computer Science major and Advanced Mathematics major there may be varying amounts of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses to bring the total to 240 UOC. Those electives must be taken from the Faculty of Engineering and/or the Faculty of Science.
In some cases, course overlaps will require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically:
- Students must complete MATH1141 and MATH1241 or higher versions.

Students may not count 'COMP' courses towards their Science requirements unless they are specified as core courses in their major (i.e. for these students 'COMP' courses will not count as 'Science' courses).
Enrolment Disclaimer
Please read the Double Degree Program rules as some specific rules apply to particular Double Degree combinations.
You are responsible for ensuring you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and advice from your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program.
