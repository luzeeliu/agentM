This course equips students with the technical skills needed to estimate survival models, emphasising their applications in insurance, finance, demography, and epidemiology. These models help understand and predict risks related to events such as mortality, health changes, and credit defaults, allowing for better risk management. Key topics include: survival models; estimation of lifetime distributions; maximum likelihood estimation of transition intensities in multi-state models; graduation and smoothing of crude death rates and transition intensity estimates; and models for projecting mortality trends. The course will also focus on implementing these concepts using numerical computer packages. Additionally, it will address ethical considerations and issues related to discrimination and heterogeneity in mortality and health outcomes.
