The MSc degree provides a basic training in research. Each candidate is given an individual research topic and carries out research on the topic under the personal supervision of a member of staff within one of the three departments of the School of Mathematics and Statistics. On completion of the research the results are incorporated into a thesis which is submitted for examination by international experts in the field. Details of the research areas which are presently available in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, as well as recent research thesis are available on the
Mathematics
website.
The MSc degree can be undertaken either full-time or part-time (or, in some cases, externally). For a full-time candidate the degree normally requires two years of study but a candidate with a first-class honours degree or with previous research experience can apply to have the period reduced by up to one year.

An honours degree is normally required for admission as an MSc candidate, but applicants with a good pass degree may be admitted to a qualifying program, which usually consists of part or all of the honours year of the relevant department.
Applications for admission to UNSW as a graduate student are accepted all year round.
Entry to the courses is on the recommendation of the Head of School or nominee (in practice the Director of Postgraduate Studies in mathematics); due consideration is given to all aspects of each applicant's undergraduate, graduate, and professional background.
