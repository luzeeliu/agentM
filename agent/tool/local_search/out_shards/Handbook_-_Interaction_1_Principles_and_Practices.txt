This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of Interaction Design, with a focus on creating cohesive user experiences through physical prototyping methods. Understanding a user's experience is the cornerstone of any interaction design project and in this course that foundation is developed from an abstract level of designing for tangible interactions. Throughout this course, you will delve into the material, conceptual, and practical aspects of designing interactive experiences that utilise various physical and digital technologies, including key concepts that underpin the process-oriented nature of designing for a user experience. Examining both physical and digital interfaces to develop a comprehensive understanding of how to design effective and engaging tangible interfaces will require critical thinking, observation, creative problem-solving, and reflective design practices.
