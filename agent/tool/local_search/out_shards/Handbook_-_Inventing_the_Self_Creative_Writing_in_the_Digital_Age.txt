What does it mean to be a writer in this age of reality hunger, when fact and fiction are shared side-by-side online, and poetry is read more on phones than in codex books? This course outlines the history of creative writing as it has grown with digital media and guides you through developing your own creative work in response to the digital age. We will explore how literature has competed with, absorbed, and remediated new technologies of communication. We will approach ‘creative writing’ as a mode of expression that emerges from and circulates within the larger textual landscape of the digital sphere. You will produce and refine your own creative work and give feedback to your peers in a workshop-based classroom. Through writing exercises, discussion, and assessments, you will develop technical skills in writing and a critical view of producing, publishing, and circulating literary work in the digital age.
