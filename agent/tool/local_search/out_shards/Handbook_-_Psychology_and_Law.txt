This course provides an introduction and broad overview to the discipline of Forensic Psychology. You will be introduced to a wide range of topics in forensic psychology, covering both criminal and civil law. Topics include jury decision making, eyewitness memory, criminal profiling, children and the courts, victims and offenders, policing, and the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders. The course will draw on cognitive, social and clinical psychological research. The goal is to demonstrate how psychological research can help us to understand and reform all aspects of the legal process. Teaching activities include two hours of lectures each week and a series of laboratory classes supported by a set of online modules. The laboratory classes include role-plays and demonstrations designed to reinforce topics covered in the lectures.
In addition to providing an introduction to Forensic Psychology, the course may offer a useful foundation for students interested in further study of forensic psychology at the Masters, Doctoral or PhD level.
Some of the topics covered in this course are also introduced in the level 1 course, PSYC1027 Forensic Psychology: Crime, Courts and Corrections. These common topics are covered in greater depth in PSYC3301, and additional topics are introduced. PSYC1027 is not a prerequisite for this course.
