As the aviation industry is generating data at an increasing rate, intelligent analysis of these outputs is becoming more important for safe, efficient and sustainable air transport. This course covers the basics of operational flight data, including an understanding of data sources, validation and use, and key parameters, but also focuses on the analysis of the data.
Through a combination of readings, case-based learning, and hands-on analysis tasks, students have the opportunity to develop skills transferrable to their own careers in aviation. This includes understanding how to use and analyse flight data in various aviation contexts including in defining and scoping an aviation study, statistical analysis using airline flight data analysis programs, and in case studies and data-mining techniques. There is an emphasis on students gaining hands-on analysis experience using actual airline flight data sets.
This fully online course is intended for professional flight crew, aviation managers, researchers, regulatory authority personnel, and persons who would benefit from a more complete knowledge of flight data analytics.
