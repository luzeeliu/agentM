The major in Cybersecurity Management is designed for undergraduate students in the Business School who are interested in developing a deep understanding of the key principles and practices of cybersecurity management. This major provides students with a broad range of skills and knowledge necessary to address the complex challenges facing organisations in today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.
Students in the Cybersecurity Management major will develop a strong understanding of the business fundamentals (including finance, accounting, marketing, management, and operations) through their BCOM integrated first year courses, which is essential for making informed decisions related to cybersecurity risk management in a business context. They will also develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills to analyse realistic and complex cybersecurity scenarios and recommend effective solutions that align with organisational goals and objectives.
In addition, students will develop effective communication skills to communicate technical cybersecurity information to a variety of stakeholders across an organisation, including executives, IT professionals, non-technical staff, and business partners. They will also learn how to work collaboratively with diverse teams to identify and address cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, and to implement effective cybersecurity programs and strategies.
Students in the Cybersecurity Management major will also develop an understanding of the ethical, legal, regulatory, and social implications of cybersecurity in a global context. They will learn how to develop policies and practices that promote responsible business practices, such as protecting customer data privacy and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Finally, they will develop strong leadership skills inspired by contemporary approaches and motivate teams to achieve the business’ cybersecurity goals, and drive organisational changes related to cybersecurity governance and risk management.

Arrangements for 3584 Commerce / Information Systems Students
keyboard_arrow_down
Students may choose INFSG1 as their major for the Bachelor of Commerce component. However, all overlapping courses cannot be applied to both INFSG1 and the Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS) program.
INFS1701 and INFS2701 must be counted towards INFSG1, and students must complete two additional level 2/3 Prescribed Information Systems Electives to replace INFS1701 and INFS2701 in the BIS program.
INFS2822 and INFS3701 must be counted towards BIS requirements and so cannot be chosen as INFSG1 electives. Students must complete three other courses (2 of which must be INFS3XXX courses) from the INFSG1 Prescribed Electives list.
Arrangements for 3784 Commerce / Computer Science Students
keyboard_arrow_down
For students enrolled in the double-degree program Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Science (Computer Science, non-Security Engineering major),  COMP6441/COMP6841 is counted as a Business school course. Additionally, students must choose three INFSG1 Prescribed Electives offered by the Business School to fulfil the 96 UOC Business School disciplinary requirement. Students cannot count COMP electives towards INFSG1 requirements.
For students enrolled in the double degree program Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Science (Computer Science- Security Engineering major), COMP6441/COMP6841 and completed COMPXXXX courses from the INFSG1 Prescribed Electives list must be counted towards the Computer Science - Security Engineering major. Therefore, students must complete additional INFSG1 electives offered by the Business School to fulfil the 48 UOC major requirement and 96 UOC Business School disciplinary requirement.
