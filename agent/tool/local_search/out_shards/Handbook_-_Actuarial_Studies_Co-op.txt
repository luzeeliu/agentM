The
Bachelor of Actuarial Studies (Co-op) (BActSt (Co-op))
is a highly valued and unique business qualification. It provides high-achieving students with a strong, 4-year academic program, integrated with fully assessable industry placement experiences that enable students to work with some of Australia's leading employers.

A scholarship is payable from funds donated by the sponsoring organisations, and entry to the program is limited to students awarded a scholarship through the BActSt(Co-op) selection procedures administered by the Co-op Program Office. For baseline requirements to the UNSW Co-op program visit the

Highly regarded by industry
Provides students with the fundamentals of business and the option to explore their interests

Equips students with the skills and knowledge to pursue a variety of career options
Allows students to qualify for professional accreditation in a range of areas.
Actuarial Studies involves the application of statistical and financial analysis and risk models to management in general, life and health insurance, superannuation, investment and finance.
The Actuarial Studies program serves as a foundation for students who wish to enter the actuarial profession. Students must achieve the required academic standard in their Actuarial Studies courses to gain exemption from the Foundation Program of the Actuaries Institute professional examinations, and the Validation by Educational Experience (VEE) credit for the Society of Actuaries (USA) and Casualty Actuarial Society (USA).  Students (esp. Actuarial Studies (Co-op) students and dual degree students) may also be eligible to gain exemption from the university accreditation components of the Actuary Program of the Actuaries Institute professional examinations. Students who wish to complete their studies with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (UK) may be eligible to receive credit for subjects for which they have credit with the Actuaries Institute via Transfer of Prior Learning (TPL).
The actuarial program of study also aims to develop the use of judgement and to provide the necessary combination of mathematical, statistical, accounting, economic, financial, demographic, analytical and quantitative modelling skills for a rewarding career in the financial services industry. Employers in the financial services industry – including banks, insurers and consultants – value the rigorous quantitative risk training in the Actuarial Studies major.
