This specialisation is for students commencing from 2024.
Global Development explores social, political and economic change throughout the world. Economic development is proceeding rapidly in some countries and among some communities, while others are being left behind. Urbanisation is accelerating; disparities are widening; the environment is threatened; communication and other technologies have been transformed—how do we grapple with these changes, their pace, the winners and losers? The field of development studies explores these issues and navigates the tools and traps for addressing them.
Many of the world’s greatest challenges require knowledge of the underlying causes, variations, and diverse consequences. Global Development is concerned with identifying processes of uneven development, impacts, and responses at the local, national, and global levels. Situations are complex, requiring interdisciplinary engagements and a deep understanding of context. Global Development is a field driven by knowledge ‘on the ground’ in order to connect the experiences of people in their everyday lives with larger national and global processes of change. Global Development students learn to critically analyse change and develop the tools to investigate and address changes taking place all over the world. Global Development graduates ensure that research and practice is done in line with ethical principles, in ways that mitigate negative consequences and at its best, improve the lives of people.
