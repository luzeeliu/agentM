This course introduces the essential concepts of fluid mechanics, focusing on the behaviour and processing of fluids and particulate materials at scale. Engineers designing artificial hearts, refining chemical feedstocks, generating renewable energy fuels, optimising food production, or improving water treatment systems must understand how fluids and particles behave to create efficient and cost-effective processes.
Students will learn to describe fluid and particle properties, understand fluid statics and dynamics, and apply this knowledge to real-world systems involving pipes, pumps, and other equipment. The course introduces modelling techniques such as differential and dimensional analysis to predict and optimise fluid motion. Additionally, key unit operations for handling particulate materials, like classification, mixing, and comminution, will be covered.
This course delves into the deeper principles that govern fluid motion. You'll embark on a journey that merges mathematical frameworks with physical intuition, empowering you to predict and design fluid flows for real-world engineering challenges. By the end of the course, you’ll have developed both the analytical tools and intuitive understanding necessary to analyse, predict, and design fluid flows in various engineering contexts, preparing you to tackle complex industrial, environmental, energy, and health challenges with confidence.
