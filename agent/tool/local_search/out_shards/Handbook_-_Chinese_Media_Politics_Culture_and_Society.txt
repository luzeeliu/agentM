China offers a rich and dynamic context for examining the politics, culture, and societal impact of media. The size and complexity of Chinese politics, economy and society, along with China’s growing influence on global media landscapes make it a critical site for understanding how media is shaped, controlled, and consumed. This course explores contemporary Chinese media through political, cultural, and sociological lenses, with particular attention to the contested and evolving developments in digital technologies, platforms, and practices. This course explores the systems, ideologies, and power relations that underpin Chinese media. It will also enable you to engage critically with a wide range of media and communication practices in China and gain advanced knowledge of its ecosystems, from governance and regulation to content production to circulation and consumption.
