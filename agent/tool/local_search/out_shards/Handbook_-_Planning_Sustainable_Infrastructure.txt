The course builds on introductory knowledge from Stages 1 to 3 in water, transport, waste and engineering operations and enables students to design infrastructure systems that include social and cultural context, as well as having regard to sustainability principles in the planning of urban and regional precincts. The design brief will direct the conceptual planning of the infrastructure and allow students to be familiar with sustainability in terms of water and waste management, transport services, energy supply and distribution. This capstone course will encourage teamwork as well as independent and reflective learning through the delivery of individual and group assessment tasks that allow for critical thinking and the development of creative and appropriate sustainable outcomes in urban and regional communities.
