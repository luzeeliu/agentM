The three-year Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions has been developed to train scientists to meet the current, and future, strong demand for Data Scientists and Data Analysts.
Graduates will have broad and coherent knowledge and skills in Data Science across the three areas of mathematics and statistics, computer science, and economics, and they will gain deeper knowledge of Data Science in one of these three areas by pursuing studies in one of three streams.
Students will also have the opportunity to increase their breadth of experience using electives.
The Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions has been designed to:
Develop graduates who have a working knowledge of scientific criteria and methods of investigation, and a concern for objectivity and precision.
Enable students to understand the significance of science, technology, economics and social factors in modern society, and of the contributions they can make in improving material conditions.
Produce graduates able to read critically and with understanding, to think logically, and to communicate clearly by written and oral means.
Create graduates able to analyse information critically in a mathematical setting.
Allow students to understand the role of speculation in the selection and solution of problems, the construction of hypotheses, and the design of experiments.
Train graduates to work successfully as part of a team.
Train students to demonstrate knowledge and skills in formulating problems involving both qualitative and quantitative data.
Produce graduates able to prepare, process, interpret and present data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative techniques.
Enable students to apply mathematical and computational techniques and business sensibilities to real-world problems involving complex data sets.
Encourage graduates to apply the highest ethical standards to their professional and personal lives
Provide opportunities for the development of students' motivations and social maturity, and an awareness of their capabilities in relation to a choice of career which will be fruitful to themselves and to society.

Science Handbook Rules and Editions
Students must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year they commence their studies with the Faculty of Science.
Students who transfer from another UNSW Faculty into Science (for example, from a Bachelor of Arts into a Bachelor of Science) must follow the program rules and requirements in the UNSW Handbook published in the year of their transfer.
Students who are readmitted to UNSW after a period of unapproved absence or deferment, or after exclusion, must satisfy the program rules in the Handbook published in the year of their readmission. In addition, these students may be subject to restrictions on which courses taken at UNSW may be counted on their return. In some cases, students returning from an unapproved absence may be required to repeat courses. See the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Advanced Standing sections for more details. Students who take approved leave or deferment will follow the Handbook for the year of their original commencement unless otherwise approved by the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).
Faculty of Science Rules
The Faculty of Science has some rules that relate to all students enrolled in programs offered by the Faculty in relation to recognition for prior learning, general education, course exclusions, study load, and cross-institutional study. All students should read the information contained on the
Faculty General Rules and Requirements
page.
