Overview
This course introduces the student to the terminology, principles and methods used in engineering fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is a subject that deals with both fluid statics (fluids at rest) and fluid dynamics (fluids in motion). Fluid flow has a broad application area ranging from car/aeroplane aerodynamics, heat exchangers, combustion… For more content click the Read More button below.
This course introduces the student to the terminology, principles and methods used in engineering fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics is a subject that deals with both fluid statics (fluids at rest) and fluid dynamics (fluids in motion). Fluid flow has a broad application area ranging from car/aeroplane aerodynamics, heat exchangers, combustion systems, micro-fluidics, and flows in artificial hearts. The knowledge of fluid mechanics gained in this course is a springboard for many other courses studied in the mechanical engineering degree program, including advanced thermofluids (heat transfer and advanced thermodynamics), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), automobile engine technology, and aerodynamics and propulsion, as well as other disciplines.
