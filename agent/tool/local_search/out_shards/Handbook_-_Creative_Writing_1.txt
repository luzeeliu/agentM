This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
The minor in Creative Writing provides you with a strong disciplinary base in creative writing and literary studies, with a focus on poetics, fiction writing, narratology and ficto-criticism.
Through workshop-based core courses, you will acquire skills in the craft of writing and develop your capacity to assess, revise and edit your own work. You will also build upon critical reading skills fostered in the discipline of literary studies and put these into practice in writing workshops.
By completing a minor in Creative Writing, you will develop critical and analytical strengths through your engagement with literature, while the workshop-based courses will encourage you to test your knowledge creatively. You will be encouraged to experiment with a variety of different styles and genres. The minor will challenge you to develop formal and technical skills through the production of imaginative work in the area of poetics, narratology, and more specialist modes of production.
