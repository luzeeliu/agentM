This course is designed for students enrolled in food science programs and specialisations and aims to equip students with a contemporary understanding of the theory and analytical techniques used in the food chemistry/science sector. This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of water, spectroscopy, amino acids, proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins. The laboratory sessions focus on analysis of major and minor food nutrients, and data interpretation. This includes proximate analysis of the major food groups, together with specialised analyses such as reducing-sugars, saponification value, iodine value, peroxide value, acid value, polarimetry, GLC of fatty acid esters and HPLC of antioxidants and vitamin C.
The course delivers the initial theory via weekly online, pre-recorded lectures. This is followed by weekly in-person workshops and laboratories which provide students with the opportunity to apply the theory to real-world food science contexts.
At the end of this course, students will be ready to take on work placements or internships in the food science sector as the course focuses on modern hands-on methods of food analysis.
