LAWS1121 – Legal System and Skills A (‘LSSA’) is a core course for Humanities Pathway Program (Law) students.
The focus of LSSA is to examine the nature of law in Australian society. It teaches about the historical foundations and contemporary workings of the Australian legal system by adopting a critical and contextual approach. Students develop an understanding of law in practice through visiting courts and tribunals, which complements theoretical learning about the Australian common law. Integrated into LSSA is the development of introductory academic skills including critical analysis, oral and written communication, academic literacy, problem-solving and research.
These skills and knowledge are an essential foundation for subsequent core courses for Humanities Pathway Program (Law) students in Term 2 and Term 3.
