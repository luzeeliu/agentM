This course introduces you to the main institutions, actors, and practices of the United States political system. You will explore the historical evolution and contemporary powers of the Presidency, Congress, and the judiciary; the US electoral system; US federalism; and the key political issues, challenges, and dilemmas that the US faces. You will consider the contemporary turbulence of US politics, including the controversies of the Trump administrations, political polarisation, and the ongoing conflicts and struggles over race and racialisation within American politics and society. The course actively encourages you to assess the promises of US democracy and concepts of freedom and liberty against the lived realities of American peoples, particularly First Nations and Black Americans. You will also evaluate the resilience of US democratic institutions and conventions in the context of contemporary populist and authoritarian trends.
