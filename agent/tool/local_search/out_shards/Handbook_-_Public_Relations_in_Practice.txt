To make the leap from studying public relations to working as a professional you need practical experience designing and implementing communication strategies. This course gives you the chance to put public relations into practice in the not-for-profit sector. You will engage with a real-world brief to identify and define a communication problem or obstacle for an organisation. You will research this problem, develop a strategic communication plan to solve it, and implement your plan. You will have the opportunity to develop strategic communication tactics related to advocacy, design, marketing, media content and online platforms in a real-life scenario. The practical skills you gain and the professional networks you develop during this course will augment your portfolio and CV, build your professional networks, and help you to shape your future career trajectory.
