This course will explore the institutional and regulatory framework that influences the employer/employee relationship in Australia. We will examine the legal dimensions of different modes of employment, remuneration, industrial action, health and safety regulation, termination of employment, as well as equity and discrimination law. The subject is not designed to equip students to practice labour law; nor is prior legal knowledge required or expected. It is, however, intended to help you acquire a good historical, theoretical and practical working knowledge of the Australian legal system pertaining to labour relations. Crucially, through this course, you can learn about your rights and obligations as an employer/practitioner/employee under current Australian legislation.
