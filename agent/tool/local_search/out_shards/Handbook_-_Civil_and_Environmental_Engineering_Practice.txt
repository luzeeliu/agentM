This course is about the doing of engineering design. It will help students develop their engineersmanship. The course will make students appreciate there is more to design than analysis and following codes, and that it is a creative and innovative process. Many parts of the civil and environmental engineering curriculums involve students learning mechanistic and law-like solutions to problems, guided by text books and design standards. This type of problem solving is important. But it is just as important for students to be creative and innovative in their problem solving. Rapid urbanisation around the world means problems are becoming more complex and unexpected requiring solutions for which text books and design standards are of limited use.
