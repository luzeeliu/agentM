The Master of Mining Engineering is a postgraduate degree program designed to provide advanced education in mining engineering, combining both theoretical knowledge and practical industry experience. It is ideal for individuals who are either already working in the mining sector or planning to enter this dynamic field. This program offers a flexible structure, allowing students to complete the degree on either a full-time or part-time basis, depending on their professional and personal commitments.
The Master of Mining Engineering will be awarded after successful completion of 72 Units of Credit (UOC), consisting of a combination of core courses, prescribed electives, and a research project. The program is designed to meet the needs of working professionals in the mining industry, offering many of the courses in modular formats (block periods), which allows students to attend face-to-face or online lectures without interrupting their work schedules. A number of electives may only be offered every two years, providing flexibility for students in terms of course selection.
NOTE:
Some electives may only be offered every two years.
Courses are offered in intensive block mode or fully distance. Students should contact the school on mere.admin@unsw.edu.au for a copy of the latest MINE PG Coursework Calendar.
International students on a student visa are required to study no more than one third of the program online.
