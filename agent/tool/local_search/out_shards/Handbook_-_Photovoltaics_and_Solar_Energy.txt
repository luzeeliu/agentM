Overview
The specialisation includes training in photovoltaics technology development, manufacturing, quality control, reliability and life-cycle analysis, cell interconnection and encapsulation, a range of solar cell applications, system planning and design, operation, maintenance and fault diagnosis and electricity industry integration.

The specialisation includes training in photovoltaics technology development, manufacturing, quality control, reliability and life-cycle analysis, cell interconnection and encapsulation, a range of solar cell applications, system planning and design, operation, maintenance and fault diagnosis and electricity industry integration. While the degree focuses on photovoltaics, electives can be taken across a range of relevant courses in electrical or mechanical engineering, renewable energy and complementary technologies such as battery storage. Emphasis is placed on gaining hands-on experience of working with solar energy devices, modules and systems.
UNSW academics in the photovoltaic field have been consistently ranked amongst the leaders worldwide through international peer review. This team has held the world record for silicon solar cell efficiencies for decades and were responsible for developing the most successfully commercialized new photovoltaic technology internationally throughout the same period. From 2006 onwards we have seen an explosion of interest in the School's technologies from major industry players all around the world.
Second Area of Specialisation
The cross-disciplinary nature of photovoltaics and renewable energy applications necessitates many PV engineers possessing broad engineering backgrounds or else working in teams with other engineers.
A unique feature of this specialisation is that in Year 2, students have the opportunity to select a strand comprising 18 units of credit to complement their education in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. The strands available cover areas such as computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and architecture. Students may also formulate their own strands subject to the approval of the specialisation authority.
Selection of a second area of specialisation is subject to the specialisation rule that states that no more than 60 UOC of first-year level courses may be counted toward the BE (Hons) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy.
