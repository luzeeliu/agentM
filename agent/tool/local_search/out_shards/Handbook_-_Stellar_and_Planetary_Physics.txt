Since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995, astronomers have discovered more than 10,000 planets orbiting other stars. What processes govern the formation of these planets and their host stars, and how do they affect one another? What is the ultimate fate of our Solar System and star systems like it, and how do we know?
In this course, students will explore stars and planetary systems in detail. Throughout the course, students develop an understanding of the building blocks of stars and planets, how they form, and how they evolve over time. They will learn about the telescopes and surveys, present and upcoming, used to understand the physics of these systems. Students will have the opportunity to analyse real telescope data related to topics covered in this course to appreciate how scientific theories are tested in practice. In developing the skills of professional astronomers, students will also critically evaluate current open questions related to stellar or planetary astronomy and produce a proposal highlighting how future observations could solve astronomical mysteries.
Topics to be covered include: stellar structure, star and planetary formation and evolution, stellar spectra in relation to fundamental properties, end states of stars, exoplanet detection and characterisation, planetary atmospheres and interior structures, and stellar activity and its effect on habitability.
