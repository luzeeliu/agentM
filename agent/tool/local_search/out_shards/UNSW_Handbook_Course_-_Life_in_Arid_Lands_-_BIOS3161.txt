Description
Forty-four percent of Australia is desert and a further 37% is semi-arid grassland or shrub communities. These arid lands contribute much to our unique biodiversity. We examine the history of the formation of the Australian arid lands, their characteristics relative to other arid parts of the world, the evolutionary history of the flora and fauna, adaptations of plants and animals to arid environments, the major arid lands ecosystems and conservation of biodiversity. We apply biological knowledge to issues of land degradation, salinisation of soils, dryland farming, feral animal control and wildlife management for a sustainable future. A field trip to Western NSW is an essential part of the course and students will incur expenses.
Note:
A compulsory field trip will be held and personal expenses will be incurred.
