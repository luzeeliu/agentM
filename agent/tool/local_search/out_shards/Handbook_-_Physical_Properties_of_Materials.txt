This Level 2 core course in Materials Science and Engineering introduces students to the physical properties of materials and their application in the design and operation of functional devices. These devices include critical components found in electric vehicles, computers, televisions, mobile telephones, and more.
The course begins with a discussion of the limitations of classical physics in describing physical properties. Elementary quantum and statistical mechanics are then introduced to provide a more accurate description, demonstrated firstly by explaining electronic conduction in materials and their categorisation as insulators, semiconductors, metals, and superconductors.  Students will also learn about intrinsic (pure) and extrinsic (doped) semiconductors and the concept of selective doping to create p-n junctions, the essential building blocks of electronic devices.
The course then focuses on magnetic materials, with particular emphasis on their ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties, including the origin of spontaneous magnetisation, magnetic domains, magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic hysteresis.  Thermal properties are also discussed, focusing on the roles of phonons and electrons on heat capacity, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and thermoelectricity. Lastly, students will learn about optical properties, and the interaction of materials with light through absorption, transmission, refraction, and reflection.
Examples of technologically significant electronic, magnetic, thermal and optical devices are provided to demonstrate the application of the fundamental principles presented in the course.
This course is a core component of the BE(Hons) (Materials Science and Engineering) program and the Materials Science Major of the BSc and BAdvSci(Hons) programs.
The course includes lectures, problem-solving sessions, in-person laboratory classes, assignments, and tests.
Previous knowledge of first year calculus, physics, and chemistry is required.
