The emphasis in this course will be 'the experience'. It is designed to be experiential rather than lecture-theatre based.
You will be placed as an Intern in a startup around Sydney.
You will be part of that startup team, working on a strategic project that will be of significant value to the startup. It is an excellent immersive experience! Very rarely, if at all, does someone get the opportunity to work in a startup environment. The expectation is that you would spend, on average, a day a week in the startup. You will use the material you have learned in the core course, together with bringing to bear your experience prior to the MBA, plus the experiences you have already had.
Overall, the aim of the course is to provide you with a significant 'immersive' and 'experiential' experience as an entrepreneur in real life. It is very rare that you would experience this anywhere else.
