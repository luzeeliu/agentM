The Profession of Architecture examines a range of concepts and contemporary issues related to professional practice and the architectural profession. Scales and types of architectural practice models, the agency of the architect and the role of the architect as advocate and public intellectual will be explored. Key learnings are founded in a review of the development of the architectural profession and its structures and networks, as well as the role of the architect in the past and present.
You will engage in detailed study of the expectations placed on the architect and the ethical and legal requirements of the architect as a professional practitioner. You will also investigate the ongoing shaping of the profession’s narratives via traditional, alternative and emerging modes of practice. This will include a review of management and business structures and the contexts of the public sphere, power and politics will also be considered alongside professional responsibilities and opportunities within and outside of traditional architectural practice. You will examine a range of concepts and current issues related to professional practice and the architectural profession. As well as looking at the expectations placed on the registered architects and the ethical and legal requirements of the architect as a professional practitioner, this course examines scales and types of architectural practice models, the agency of the architect and the role of the architect as advocate and public intellectual.
