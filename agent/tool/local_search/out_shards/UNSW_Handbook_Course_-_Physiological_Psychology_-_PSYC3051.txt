Description
This course deals with elementary learning processes and their neurobiological substrates. These include: learning about relations between stimuli (e.g., Pavlovian conditioning); learning about relations between actions and outcomes (e.g., instrumental conditioning); how goals are represented and how they drive behaviour; and the development of habitual and compulsive behaviours. There will be an overview of the role of appetitive and aversive motivation in learning, behaviour and psychopathology. Emphasis will be placed on contemporary theories and approaches, including discussion of the role of molecular signalling cascades and neuronal coding in learning and memory, the role of neural systems in supporting behaviour, and examples of where changes in such systems are thought to underpin human mental disorders.
