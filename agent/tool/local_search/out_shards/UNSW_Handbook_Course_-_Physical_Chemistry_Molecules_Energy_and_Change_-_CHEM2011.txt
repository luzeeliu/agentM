Description
Physical Chemistry seeks to explain chemical processes in terms of energy changes and the molecular nature of matter. This course introduces quantum mechanics and its role in determining the energy levels of atoms and molecules, followed by the physical basis for understanding the factors affecting reaction rates, the role of reaction mechanisms, and molecular theory of reaction rates. The course then introduces the molecular basis underpinning the laws of thermodynamics and their applications in chemistry, with specific attention given to the application of thermodynamics to electrochemical processes. To complete, the course introduces the surface and colloid chemistry which explains many important natural and technologically important phenomena.
