What roles does the digital play in shaping our lived existence? How does the digital shape and change our everyday world? What does living in a world of increased digitalisation mean for our understanding of public and private, and of the boundaries between the digital and the self? These are some of the questions that this course tackles. This course explores how digital platforms, data systems, and algorithms, mediate lived experience in contemporary society. Drawing on sociological concepts and case studies, you will critically examine how digital environments reconfigure identity/ies, embodiment, relationships, and notions of community. Together, we will consider the various dimensions of digital life, the politics of visibility and voice online, and how power operates through platforms that track, categorise, and influence behaviours, relationships, and selves. You will consider how digital spaces are navigated through self-presentation on social media, participation in virtual communities, and/or in resistance to digital surveillance.
