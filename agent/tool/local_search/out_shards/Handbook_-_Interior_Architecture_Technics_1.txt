Interior Architecture Technics 1 sets the foundation for the craft and discipline of Interior Architecture. You will be introduced to the people, processes, principles, and primary building elements of Interior Architecture through lectures and weekly studio-based workshops. You will explore core considerations around the role of the interior architect, and the design, documentation, and construction processes. In addition, you will develop a basic understanding of the key aspects of design-making including aesthetics, functionality and sustainability, structural principles, and basic constructional assemblies. You will demonstrate your understanding of basic materiality, and the typical construction assemblies through industry standard documentation practices. This course is designed to be completed alongside Year 1 Interior Architecture (Hons) courses and Interior Technics courses.
