Aviation management involves the overseeing of various aviation departments and being able to communicate, coordinate and manage readily and effectively when addressing many complex aviation challenges and scenarios. Therefore, to be a successful aviation manager, you must have a solid foundational understanding of key aviation concepts from which to draw upon during the various stages of your career and day-to-day responsibilities. This course explores concepts including the principles of flight; aeroplane performance, components, and systems; regulations; meteorology; and threat and error management. There is also a direct emphasis on the aspects of operational aeronautical knowledge relevant to aviation managers which will be taught through a combination of lectures, tutorials, and scenario-based learning.
