'The Graduation Project is the culmination of the Computational Design studios and the Bachelor of Computational Design degree. CODE3201 and CODE3202 are one package and students must be enrolled in both courses. CODE3202 develops rigorous testing and systematic skills for developing a research informed solution within the context of a practice-based computational design project. This is aligned with the Computational Design degree overarching goal to prepare students by developing research knowledge and reflective practice, and exposing them to the theoretical and practical principles associated with a research informed approach. Students will be either partnered with an industry-based supevisor to design a solution for a "real-world" problem, or will be requested to develop an independent research question. The course culminates in the authorship of a physical or digital prototype, that reflects a critical thinking as well as a systematic and professional research approach.
