The course provides students with a deep understanding of modern operating system technology, implementation techniques and research issues.
This course builds upon the basic operating systems course (COMP3231/9201/3891/9283), which provides an understanding of the underlying operating systems which students have implicitly relied upon in developing applications in foundational courses within Computer Science and Engineering, and will rely on in their future careers when developing systems and applications. Advanced operating systems enables students to specialise in operating systems, giving them the skills and insight to become highly competent developers or researchers in the general “systems” space, including operating systems, network systems, embedded and cyberphysical systems. The course produces graduates who are highly sought-after by technology companies and systems researchers.
