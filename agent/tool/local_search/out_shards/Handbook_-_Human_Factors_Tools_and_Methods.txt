Understanding human factors is critical to improving complex systems, so that systems, tasks, systems and interfaces need to be designed with consideration of the abilities and limitations of humans. A range of tools and methodologies are used in human factors practice to proactively identify these issues to inform task and system design, or to retrospectively analyse these issues to improve future performance.
This course outlines human factors tools and methods from task analysis techniques to complex systems analysis methods and discusses their advantages, disadvantages, intended applications, and limits in practice and interpretation. Students will have opportunities to apply elements of the tools to examples from different industries tasks and systems, analyse their results, and formulate recommendations for task and system re-design.
