The Climate Systems Science minor provides an introduction to the science of the Earth's climate system. Students will learn the fundamentals of the atmosphere, ocean and land processes, and how these inform our understanding of climate change. Critically, students will learn about risks relating to climate change, how these are predicted and learn to separate fact from fiction, and greenwashing from genuine action. This minor will provide a foundation in climate systems that is relevant and valuable for all science disciplines, and enable students to link their area of speciality to climate change issues.
