Description
Bioinformatics (the use of computing methods for the management and analysis of molecular biology data) has become an integral component of biomolecular sciences, especially genomics and proteomics. This course focuses on the principles and practical use of bioinformatics methods and resources for the analysis of DNA and protein sequences and structures, as well as results from microarray and proteomics, with emphasis on their evolutionary underpinnings and statistical foundations.
This course does not require programming, however it does involve the use of Linux.
