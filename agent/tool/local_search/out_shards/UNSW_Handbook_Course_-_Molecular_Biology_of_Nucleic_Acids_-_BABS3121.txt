Description
The syllabus comprises a detailed analysis of gene structure and function which includes: structure and properties of polynucleotides such as DNA and RNA; structure of chromatin; mechanisms and regulation of gene replication, transcription and translation, DNA repair and the molecular biology of cancer induction; recombinant DNA technology; nulceic acid sequencing, ecombinant DNA technology, application of genomics and proteomics, microarray analyses; protein production using recombinant DNA systems. Practical work provides extensive experience with contemporary molecular techniques; literature surveys and web-based research are also used to enhance the theoretical and practical aspects of the syllabus.
