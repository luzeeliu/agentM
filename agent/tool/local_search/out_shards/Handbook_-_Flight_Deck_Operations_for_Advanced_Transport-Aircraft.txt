Advanced transport aircraft are modern aircraft containing such features as integrated electronic displays, advanced automation modes and flight management systems. This course takes a holistic approach to analysing the factors involved in safe operation of advanced transport aircraft, beginning with a description of current accident statistics, and their analyses.
Through a combination of case-based learning, readings, and assessments, the course will introduce students to areas relating to advanced transport aircraft. These include advanced aircraft technology, human factors and situational awareness, aircraft control theory and flight deck controls, advanced automation, interfaces between aircraft and crew, and flight deck management. Students will also have the opportunity to test their understanding and skills throughout the course, and develop skills transferrable to their own careers in the aviation industry.
This fully online course is intended for professional flight crew, aviation managers, equipment manufacturers, researchers, regulators and interested parties who would benefit from a more complete knowledge of this complex area.
