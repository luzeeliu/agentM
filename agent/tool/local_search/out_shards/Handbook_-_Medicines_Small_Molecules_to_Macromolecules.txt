This course will provide you with an understanding of what medicinal chemistry is, and how it is carried out. It will describe the interdisciplinary process of how new medicines are designed and developed.
The first major section of the course contains a refresher of some fundamental concepts in organic chemistry (e.g. structure and bonding; functional groups; intermolecular forces) and an introduction to different classes of drug targets (e.g. DNA; RNA; proteins; carbohydrates).
The second major section of the course focuses on small-molecule drug development. The various sources of lead compounds are examined, including examples from Australian traditional medicine. The concepts of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are investigated. Several valuable computational tools for drug development are introduced (e.g. docking, logP prediction). Strategies for lead optimisation are examined (e.g. isosteric replacements; metabolic fixes; rigidification; simplification; extension).
The third major section of the courses focuses on biologics and other macromolecular drugs. Several classes of biological macromolecules are examined in detail, including their structure and function; methods for their industrial production; and examples of their therapeutic use. A strong emphasis will be given to the science of mRNA vaccines. Non-natural macromolecules / nanoparticles will also be examined, including their use either as therapeutics in their own right or as delivery agents for other drugs (e.g. liposomes for mRNA vaccines).
Throughout the course, a strong emphasis will be placed on peer learning through a series of student-led workshops.
