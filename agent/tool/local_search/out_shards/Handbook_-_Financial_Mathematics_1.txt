Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
The entry requirement for the Master of Financial Mathematics is one of the following:
A recognised bachelor degree (or equivalent qualification) with a major in a cognate discipline area and an overall average of 65 or higher, as determined by the UNSW Postgraduate Coursework Entry Calculator; OR
An average of 65 or higher in at least 4 courses in mathematics or statistics at the second-year undergraduate level or above, as determined by the UNSW Postgraduate Coursework Entry Calculator.
International students:
Prospective international students need to meet the
University's English language requirements
.
Assumed knowledge:
Several variable calculus, linear algebra, probability, and theory of statistics. (Applies to both admission pathways).
Recommended knowledge:
Real analysis or measure theory, partial differential equations, and linear regression.
Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is the transfer of credit towards a program from another degree. The following policy applies to students with degrees from other institutions and students with an undergraduate degree from UNSW.
In limited cases, students with previous postgraduate or honours-level coursework, including Honours graduates from UNSW, may receive advanced standing/recognition of prior learning.  Advanced standing is limited to a maximum of 24 UoC. Students who receive the maximum 24 UoC may complete the degree with 48 UoC, or one year of full-time study.
Advanced standing will only be granted for courses at the honours or postgraduate level, not courses at the undergraduate level. Students must apply for advanced standing and the School of Mathematics and Statistics will determine if the student’s completed coursework is deemed equivalent to UNSW counterparts.  Advanced standing is not guaranteed.

Program Requirements
Progression Requirements
Students usually complete their Research Project during their last one or two terms. Students are not eligible to start a project until they have completed at least 36 UoC (typically, 6 courses).
Students may request to
exit into
an associated program after completing
at least 24 UoC
of the Master's program (8161):
Students who have completed at least 24 UoC can elect to exit the program with a Graduate Certificate (7659).
Students who have completed at least 48 UoC can elect to exit the program with a Graduate Diploma (5659).
Students may request to
transfer into
the Master's program (8161) after completing
at least 24 UoC
of an associated program:
Students who have completed the full 24 UoC of the Graduate Certificate (7659) and have a WAM of 65 may apply to transfer into this Masters program.
Students who have completed at least 24 UoC of the Graduate Diploma (5659) and have a WAM of 65 may apply to transfer into this Masters program.

Recognition of Achievement
Award with Excellence
open_in_new
Current Students Award with Excellence
For more information, please visit the link above.
The Award with Excellence is awarded in coursework masters programs, including Masters (Extension) but with the exception of Masters (Extended) such as JD and MD, when a Weighted Average Mean (WAM) of at least 80% has been achieved and at least 50% of the requirements of the award are completed at UNSW. All eligible programs will award 'with Excellence' except in special circumstances where approval of Academic Board has been given for a program to opt out.
Program Fees
At UNSW fees are generally charged at course level and therefore dependent upon individual enrolment and other factors such as student's residency status. For generic information on fees and additional expenses of UNSW programs, click on one of the following:
