This course builds on high school calculus-based courses to provide a solid foundation for further study in mathematics for students in STEM disciplines. It is taken by undergraduate students typically in their first year and is usually followed by MATH1231 or MATH1241. The Calculus half of the course develops a deeper understanding of continuous and differentiable functions and introduces the Riemann integral. It shows how theorems such as the Maximum-Minimum Theorem, the Intermediate Value Theorem and Mean Value Theorems are used to justify properties of common functions and to solve both theoretical and applied problems. The Algebra half of the course introduces vectors and matrices and the solution of systems of linear equations by Gaussian elimination which paves the way for linear algebra in later courses. Technology is used throughout the course through use of the Maple computer algebra system and students producing a typeset assignment. Students are assumed to have a good understanding of NSW HSC Mathematics Extension 1 and 2 subjects.
MATH1131 has a higher version, MATH1141, has greater depth and a greater emphasis on proof and rigorous argument than MATH1131.
