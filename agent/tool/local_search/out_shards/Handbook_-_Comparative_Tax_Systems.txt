You will explore various tax types, such as income, consumption, wealth, and environmental taxes, understanding their significance and application in different contexts.
Engage with compelling questions regarding the importance of income tax in developed countries versus the reliance on indirect taxes in developing regions, the scarcity of wealth taxes, and the widespread adoption of value-added taxes.
