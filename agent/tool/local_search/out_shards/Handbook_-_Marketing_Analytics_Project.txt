Marketing data available to firms grow exponentially. Firms that possess the marketing analytical skills to navigate data-rich environments and to exploit such data are taking the lead while firms that do not have those skills are increasingly left behind. Currently marketing analytics skills are very scarce on the job market, yet increasingly high in demand. One key challenge in the world of marketing analytics is to make the transition from applying academic concepts and methods to case studies only to generating real-life solutions for companies.
