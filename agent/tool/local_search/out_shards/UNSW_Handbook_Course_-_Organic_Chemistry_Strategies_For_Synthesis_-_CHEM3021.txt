Description
This course complements and develops further the concepts presented in CHEM2021 “Organic Chemistry: Mechanisms and Biomolecules”.
Advanced spectroscopic techniques (including infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, along with mass spectrometry) are explored with an emphasis on problem
solving, enhancing a student’s ability to apply these methods to the determination of complex organic structures.
The main emphasis of this course is on the approaches used by chemists for the synthesis of complex molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis is a logic-based tool that uses pattern recognition and mechanistic understanding for the design of synthetic pathways. The concept will be developed through solution of problems, and illustrated with classic case studies, including bioactive molecules. Selectivity and the use of protecting groups will be highlighted. An essential component of modern synthesis includes the methodology for introduction of correct stereochemical elements, and various strategies for control of stereoselectivity will be described.
