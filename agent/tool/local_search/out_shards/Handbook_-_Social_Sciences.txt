Criminal records check
keyboard_arrow_down
National Criminal Record Checks are handled on a case-by-case basis as they are only required of the students on placement when requested by agencies. A National Criminal Record Check is valid for three years. You must undergo a National Criminal Record Check and provide an original copy of the Check results to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. The result of a Working With Children Check is either that there are 'no disclosable outcomes', or that there are 'disclosable outcomes' which are then detailed in the certificate. If you have a disclosable outcome(s) on your criminal record check you will need to undergo a risk assessment. Please contact the Work Integrated Learning Unit for further information about this. All placement students are subject to ongoing monitoring and must disclose new 'disclosable outcomes' to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. Some agencies (e.g NSW Health) only accept National Criminal Record Checks obtained through specific accredited agencies.
Working with Children Check
keyboard_arrow_down
Working with Children Checks are handled on a case-by-case basis as they are only required of the students on placement when requested by agencies. The Working With Children Check is valid for five years. It is a requirement for all students and is specifically designed for people who work or volunteer in child-related work. It involves a national criminal history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct. The result of a Working With Children Check is either a clearance to work with children for five years, or a bar against working with children. Cleared applicants are subject to ongoing monitoring and relevant new records may lead to the clearance being revoked. The Working With Children Check is fully portable so it can be used for any paid or unpaid child-related work in NSW for as long as the worker remains cleared. You can apply for their Working With Children Check (WWCC) number on the NSW Office of the Children's Guardian website. To be eligible for a WWCC you will have to show proof of identity to a NSW Motor Registry or Council Agency. For more information you may access the online tutorials and fact sheets at https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.
Internship, Placement and Exchange Opportunities
Students are encouraged to take the internship and work integrated learning opportunities available in their program.
We strongly encourage students to explore the diverse range of in-person and virtual exchanges offered by UNSW Study Abroad and Exchange, which also offers tailored support for finding and engaging in exchange opportunities, financial support, and practical advice on enrolment and eligibility: https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/exchange
Students majoring in International Studies will find exchange opportunities of particular value to their student experience and future career. Courses taken on exchange can be counted towards this major.
