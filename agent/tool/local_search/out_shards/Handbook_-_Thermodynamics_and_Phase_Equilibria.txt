This Level 2 core course in Materials Science and Engineering introduces students to the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and their application in understanding the physical and chemical behaviour of pure substances, solutions, and multiphase systems relevant to the discipline.
The course begins with an overview of essential thermodynamic concepts and the three laws of thermodynamics. Building on this foundation, students learn about thermodynamic relations, gas-solid equilibria, ideal and non-ideal solutions, colligative properties, phase stability and the molecular basis of thermodynamics. Selected topics on materials thermodynamics illustrate these principles, including the oxidation and reduction of metals and oxides, thermodynamics of polymer solutions, solubility of gases in liquids and solids, lattice defects, and interfacial phenomena. The second part of the course focuses on phase equilibria, covering the types of unary and binary phase diagrams, Gibbs phase rule, lever rule, and experimental and computational tools for constructing phase diagrams. The practical application of binary phase diagrams will be utilised for designing microstructures in technologically significant material systems.
The course provides students with a solid foundation in basic thermodynamic principles and phase stability, preparing them for advanced courses requiring these essential concepts.
This course is a core component of the BE(Hons) (Materials Science and Engineering) program and the Materials Science Major of the BSc and BAdvSci(Hons) programs.
Lectures, tutorials and laboratory activities are the primary modes of delivery.
Previous knowledge of first-year chemistry, physics and calculus is recommended.
