Conceptualising the transformation of raw materials into valuable products in terms of unit operations is one of the key distinctives of chemical engineering. Translating these unit operation concepts into reality involves selecting and designing the appropriate equipment. This course will prepare you to make and justify equipment selection decisions and then prepare detailed designs of selected equipment.
Various methods of equipment selection will be explored, including Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis. You will also be introduced to how equipment selection is approached in different contexts, including water treatment and mineral processing. In particular, you will explore how priorities vary across industries and how this influences equipment selection.
Finally, you will be introduced to a range of process equipment for different unit operations and will study different aspects of detailed equipment design. These designs will encompass design criteria specification, assessment of required/optimum size, materials selection (especially for processes with special requirements such as food processes), the importance of relevant design standards and legal requirements, and detailed mechanical design. These aspects will be illustrated using heat exchangers, pressure vessels and separation equipment ranging from distillation columns to centrifuges.
