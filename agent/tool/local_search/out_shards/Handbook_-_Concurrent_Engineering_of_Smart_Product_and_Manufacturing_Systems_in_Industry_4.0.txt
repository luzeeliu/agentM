Industry 4.0 reflects the ongoing fourth industrial revolution and is one of the most active research and industry topics. In the context of Industry 4.0, the digitalisation of factory and production elements transforms today’s factories into smart ones. Concurrent Engineering is also a well-known approach to the design of products, processes, and manufacturing systems in a concurrent manner in a dynamic market environment.
This course offers an integrated approach to concurrent engineering principles and Industry 4.0 technologies, focusing on the collaborative design of products, processes, and manufacturing systems in the industry 4.0 context. Students will explore the interconnectivity of physical and digital elements within smart factories, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance productivity, product quality, and customisation while minimising environmental impact.
Key topics include:
Concurrent Engineering Principles
: Understanding the simultaneous development of products and processes in a team-oriented environment. Emphasis on customer-focused design, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Design for Manufacture (DFM), Design and Planning for Assembly (DFA), and Rapid Prototyping.
Industry 4.0 Fundamentals
: Introduction to the fourth industrial revolution, integrating cyber-physical systems with information and communication technologies. Topics include artificial intelligence, cloud computing, Big Data analytics, robotics, augmented reality, simulation, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Smart Factory Technologies
: Exploration of digitalisation in manufacturing, transforming traditional factories into intelligent, connected environments. Discussions on system architectures, data modelling, real-time simulation, optimisation methods, and cyber-security protocols for designing and deploying digital twins of manufacturing systems.
Implementation and Management
: Strategies for implementing concurrent engineering practices and Industry 4.0 technologies within organisational settings. Analysis of social impacts, opportunities, and risks associated with smart factories equipped with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
