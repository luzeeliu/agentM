This course provides an introduction to the legal system of the People's Republic of China. Emphasis is placed on modern developments in China’s commercial law, international business and economic law, and other important legal areas.
The course examines the role law plays in modern China by reference to its historical antecedents. It looks at particular areas of development, not only for their own sake, but also as indicators of the changing role of law in Chinese society. Areas that are the subject of particular attention include: elements and institutions of the Chinese legal system; the role of law in Chinese society from the perspectives of legal history and philosophy; contract law; intellectual property law; foreign investment law; corporate and securities law; foreign trade law; and mediation, arbitration and civil enforcement procedures.
In addition to classroom teaching, there will be field trips to Chinese legal institutions, such as an arbitration commission or a Chinese law firm.
