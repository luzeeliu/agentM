This course is only available to students enrolled in the School of Physics Honours Program, and the School’s Honours Coordinator must approve enrolment.
Students in this course undertake a full year research project under the supervision of an academic in the School of Physics. Taken in combination with PHYS4144 Physics Honours Research A and PHYS4146 Physics Honours Research C, this course will contribute towards the 24 UOC of research required in the Physics Honours stream at UNSW. Across these 24 UoC of project work, students will be required to submit a research proposal, a literature review, and a final thesis. Students will also be required to present a seminar at the end of their research, which will not contribute to their final mark but is a compulsory component of the degree. There is also a total of 24 UoC of Honours coursework to be completed over the year.
Students who are approved for Honours will need to enrol in this course in the second Term of their Honours year, alongside PHYS4143.
