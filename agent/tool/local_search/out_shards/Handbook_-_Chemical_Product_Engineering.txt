Chemical Product Engineering involves researching, developing and improving the properties of the products that we use every day through the selection and design of the materials that are used. Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You'll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you'll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.
The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked there.
The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.

Learning Outcomes
Expand all
1.
Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in the use of the methods, tools and ideas from chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computing that underpin chemical product engineering.
keyboard_arrow_down
2.
Solve chemical product engineering problems in formulated materials by competent application of technical knowledge in synthetic chemistry, analytical chemistry, polymer chemistry, colloids, complex fluids, material and energy balances, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction engineering, transport phenomena, economic analysis, and safety analysis.
keyboard_arrow_down
3.
Demonstrate engineering design expertise to create socially aware chemical product concepts and prototypes for solutions, enabling technically and economically viable products that are sustainable, safe, appropriate, and standards-compliant.
keyboard_arrow_down
4.
Use systems thinking to guide engineering projects, for example to articulate financial and technical constraints on product design, analyse competitive intellectual property to identify opportunities in markets and technologies, provide a basis for formulated product scale-up and manufacturing, and liaise with process engineers to judge when optimal to develop manufacturing capability or use contract manufacturers.
keyboard_arrow_down
5.
Use appropriate resources, including research data, to analyse microstructured product performance characteristics, create quantifiable product benchmarks, develop sustainable, holistic approaches while dealing with uncertainty and solving complex product engineering problems with actual social and environmental contexts.
keyboard_arrow_down
6.
Effectively manage product, material, and equipment development projects, with multidisciplinary teams of scientists, engineers and marketers with robust project planning and project management approaches that are adaptable, responsive, and appropriate in benefiting from the capabilities of diverse teams.
keyboard_arrow_down
7.
Communicate complex ideas effectively and professionally through a range of media to diverse audiences within and outside of chemical product engineering, including describing project outputs, pitching product concepts to management, technologists, and marketing, effectively incorporating, and being responsive to, feedback.
keyboard_arrow_down
8.
Conduct themselves professionally, ethically, and respectfully, be accountable as an individual, as members of teams, and as a leader of teams, while recognising the social and environmental obligations of chemical product engineers.
