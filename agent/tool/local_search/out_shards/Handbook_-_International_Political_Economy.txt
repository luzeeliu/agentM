This specialisation is for students commencing from 2023.
How can the global economy be understood and analysed in political terms, and why is this important? Studying International Political Economy (IPE) enables you to come to grips with some of the most pressing questions in and of global politics today. You will enquire into the nature of both global and local relations of economic power, including how they are sustained by shifting patterns of knowledge and authority. You will examine the features and dynamics of forces such as capitalism, globalisation, neo- and postcolonialism, and will investigate the histories, knowledges and roles of particular actors, ideas, agendas and experiences. You will explore the fault lines created by global integration, economic crisis and deepening social, political and economic inequality. As you develop your ideas and build a personal, and always political, sense of how politics shapes economics, and vice versa, you will participate directly in the evolving relationship between theory, practice and policymaking.
