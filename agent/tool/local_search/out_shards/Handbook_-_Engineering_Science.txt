The Master of Engineering Science program is designed for engineers and graduates wishing to develop and expand their knowledge and skills in their current area of expertise.* This will enable students to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards and to provide opportunities for continuing professional development, as well as the opportunity to interact with those at the cutting edge of their discipline. Students will develop their technical knowledge and ability to analyse engineering problems. They will also gain further skills in solving engineering problems and justifying professional decisions.
Students will have the chance to work on a complex, open-ended enquiry-based project. This will develop their systematic approach to a problem and require project planning and the ability to analyse, interpret and communicate results proficiently. The completion of the research provides a pathway towards postgraduate research degrees through the development and demonstration of enquiry-based skills.
(* It is also possible for students to acquire some knowledge and skills in a different specialisation with the approval of the Specialisation Authority. This may require the student to take additional foundation and disciplinary knowledge courses at the discretion of the Specialisation Authority.)
The program is designed to enable students to fulfil a number of needs including:
Updating technical knowledge and skills in an existing engineering specialisation
Acquiring new knowledge and skills in a different engineering specialisation
Updating qualifications and knowledge to meet or maintain professional accreditation standards
Providing opportunities for continuing professional development
Providing opportunities for interaction with those at the cutting edge of the discipline
Providing a preliminary step towards postgraduate research degrees

Minimum Entry Requirements
keyboard_arrow_down
Entry into the Master’s program requires completion of a 4-year Bachelor of Engineering degree (or equivalent) or 3-year Engineering Science degree in a cognate discipline.
A minimum 65% average, or its equivalent, throughout the qualifying bachelor’s degree is mandatory.
In addition, the following applies:
• a candidate applying for Project Management, Food Process Engineering, Renewable Energy, or Photovoltaics and Solar Energy is required to have a Science or Engineering Degree.
Limitations on Recognition of Prior Learning
keyboard_arrow_down
Up to 48 UOC of advanced standing may be granted to candidates with degrees from cognate programs.
All courses completed towards the Graduate Certificate or the Graduate Diploma of Engineering Science at UNSW will be recognised for the purpose of advanced standing for the Master of Engineering Science.

Program Requirements
Progression Requirements
The courses in each specialisation form an articulated sequence. Students who complete the Graduate Diploma program may upgrade to the Masters program with full credit for the courses undertaken, provided they have completed the previous program at UNSW. A pass average (50) and successful completion of 18 UOC is required to articulate to the next level in the sequence. Students who have enrolled in the Masters will be permitted to exit with a Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate in the specialisation sequence providing they have completed the requirements of that program. Subject to the approval of the program authority and available places, students will be permitted to transfer to another specialisation with credit transfer being subject to the requirements of the specialisation into which the student is transferring.

Current Students Award with Excellence
For more information, please visit the link above.
The Award with Excellence is awarded in coursework masters programs, including Masters (Extension) but with the exception of Masters (Extended) such as JD and MD, when a Weighted Average Mean (WAM) of at least 80% has been achieved and at least 50% of the requirements of the award are completed at UNSW. All eligible programs will award 'with Excellence' except in special circumstances where approval of Academic Board has been given for a program to opt out.
Additional Information
All software required for coursework is provided on the computers in the School computer laboratories. Some students find it advantageous to buy their own computer and software so that they can work at home. Some external courses may require students to own their own computer with Microsoft Office or equivalent. Specialist software packages that are required for external courses will be provided as part of the course pack to students.
