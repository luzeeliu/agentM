The Gaming and Society minor will introduce you to the key concepts and approaches used to study the world of video games and gaming subculture, with a particular focus on the social, cultural, and political implications of games and their enabling digital technologies. Situated at the intersection of diverse disciplines such as Politics and International Relations, Sociology, Media and Cultural Studies, and Fine Arts and Design, in this minor you will engage with key issues and controversies related to video games and gaming. These include the cultural, social and economic landscape of video games, gaming and Games Studies, the gendered and racialised foundations of games development and gaming subculture, violence in video games, the militarisation of games, and Gamergate, a violent reaction to a perceived 'forcing' of politics into video games. The minor will also provide you with the opportunity to critically assess the political messaging of video games and gameplay and the wider social and cultural impacts of both. This minor recognises the unique qualities of video games while also acknowledging that they are part of a broader digital media-scape.
