This 12 UoC project allows you to conduct a substantial piece of research on an environment and society leadership topic. Each project will be individually supervised and will generally require you to conduct a literature review, develop research aims and methods, and collect, interpret, and analyse data. You will produce a research report or article of approximately 12,000–13,000 words, although you may negotiate alternative formats if you would like your research outputs to be presented in a creative project format. You may select from a range of topics as agreed with your supervisor. Theoretical, conceptual, and methodological approaches are expected to be of a high standard.
Master’s students, with permission from your academic supervisor(s) you may extend your project or undertake an additional project by enrolling in more than one IEST research course.  This consent is based on staff availability to supervise the topic.
