Entrepreneurship in the 21st century is rapidly evolving. Disruptive changes in technology, manufacturing, supply chains, talent, communication, and capital markets have led to the rise of global startup ecosystems. Governments, corporates and universities are recognising the potential for the next wave of economic growth to emerge from disruptive startup enterprises, and are working together to nurture them via grants, tax incentives, direct funding, subsidised space, education, competitions, purchasing policies, mentoring and partnerships.
This course provides exposure to the fundamentals of global entrepreneurship ecosystems and the practical aspects of identifying, evaluating, and moving business ideas forward in them. The course inspires students to critically think about how entrepreneurs identify opportunities, understand customer needs, harness resources, create innovative business models, attract capital and solve real-world challenges.
The course addresses key contemporary topics in entrepreneurship ecosystems and their application in any field—from business and design to healthcare and product development. The course aims to provide foundational knowledge of entrepreneurship ecosystems, lean startup and design thinking methodologies applied in startups. Different offerings of the course will allow students to:
1. explore the rise of Sydney as one of the world’s emerging entrepreneurial cities through experiential learning, employing the latest in VR and AR technologies, or
2. undertake a study tour of an international entrepreneurial ecosystem which will include online workshops on startup best practice overseas, and a two week intensive startup ecosystem experience.
This course also provides a pathway into the UNSW Founders Program. For more information visit: https://founders.unsw.edu.au
For Business School students, this course can be counted as one of your Business School electives.
