Electricity is everywhere in the human body. Electrical impulses make it possible for us to see, hear, stand up straight, and react to pain. A disruption in physiological electrical currents can lead to illness. This course will provide you with the essential knowledge required for bio-electrodes, interfaces used to measure or control electrical signals within the human body. The course encompasses electric circuit theory and the biological mechanisms underlying electrical signals. Additionally, the course incorporates a practical component with multiple laboratory exercises covering topics in bioelectronics, programming, and bio-signal analytics and classification.
By the end of the course, you will have gained the skills and knowledge necessary to utilise various instruments, such as oscilloscopes and signal generators, for biomedical electronics. You will also acquire proficiency in using software tools like LabChart, PowerLab, and Matlab for programming, bio-signal acquisition, bio-signal/data analysis, and modelling techniques in simulating biological systems. Furthermore, you will develop an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for bioelectric signals that are measured or elicited in medical and clinical settings.
This course is designed for those without a background in programming, biological signal acquisition, and analysis, and is particularly recommended for individuals lacking experience in electrical or mechatronics engineering. Nonetheless, students from these two disciplines will gain first-hand experience collecting and analysing signals from the human body.
