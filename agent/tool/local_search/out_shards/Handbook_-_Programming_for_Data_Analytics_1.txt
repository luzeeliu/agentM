This is an intermediate PG Information Systems (IS) elective course that is designed for business students from a variety of disciplines. It introduces students to data processing and programming by providing a first step towards learning web programming technologies for data analytics. Course content is presented through three learning modules. These include Python syntax, business data processing, and managerial issues.
In Module 1, students systematically study Python syntax. In Module 2, students learn how to analyse business data using Python. This module teaches from the basics of data analytics to exploring many different types of business data. Students learn how to prepare data for analytics, perform simple statistical analysis, create meaningful data visualisations, and predict future trends from data. In Module 3, the course introduces students to emerging technologies as well as the social, legal, and ethical issues relevant to the technologies discussed in this course. Throughout the course, students are introduced to a number of Python libraries for importing datasets, data frame manipulation, visualizing the data, and building machine learning models.
