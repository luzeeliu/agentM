This course will give you an introduction to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and decentralised finance (DeFi). The course begins with a brief history of money before outlining the underlying cryptocurrency principles of blockchains. Ethereum and smart contracts are introduced, which form the basis of DeFi applications such as automated market makers, decentralised borrowing and lending markets, stablecoins, on-chain derivatives, DAOs and insurance.

The course will involve practical activities with cryptocurrencies, trading on a DEX and creating your own cryptocurrency (ERC20 token).
