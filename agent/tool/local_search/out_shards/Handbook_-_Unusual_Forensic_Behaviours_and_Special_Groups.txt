This course is an overview of less common but important forensic mental health topics relating to the unusual behaviours and special groups that can confound health and justice systems. The course will enable students to apply diverse theoretical models to unusual behaviours in order to understand the psychopathology and motivations behind the behaviours. The broader goal of this knowledge is to inform treatment and management from a range of disciplinary approaches.
The course will cover a diverse range of rarer psychiatric presentations and special groups such as intellectual disability, deception, property crime, arson, kidnapping, feigned illness, and extremism as well as miscellaneous approaches such as psychological autopsy and understanding the limits of eye witness testimony.
