A Smart Grid is the integration of numerous technologies, systems and processes with the aim to modernise and fully automate the entire electricity grid covering generation, transmission, distribution, utilisation plus conservation of energy. Smart grids will revolutionise the design, development, management, operation and maintenance of the grid to levels that were thought impossible some decades ago. The driving force behind Smart Grids include environmental awareness of people and governments; the need for further automation and energy efficiency; large capital investments for the renewal of the ageing infrastructure in most developed countries including Australia; adoption of competitive energy prices; security of supply; energy conservation and the ever-increasing electricity demand that needs to be met.
Implementation of Smart Grid strategies by power utilities necessitates a new set of skills, experiences and knowledge. Professionals and engineers working in the power industry and information and communications technologies will seek to upgrade and expand their practical skills to meet unprecedented market demand. This course provides a cross-disciplinary overview approach to the various topics of a Smart Grid ranging from the fundamentals of Smart Grids to renewable energy systems, energy storage, IT communications and standards. The course focuses mainly on intelligent electricity distribution networks and provides the basis for the new thinking and design methodology required by engineers and professionals for transforming the current distribution networks to become a major part of the future intelligent electricity network.
The appropriate background required is normally a Bachelor of Engineering but Bachelor degrees in Science, Commerce and Law might be acceptable.
