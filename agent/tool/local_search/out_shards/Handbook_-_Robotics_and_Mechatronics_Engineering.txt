The Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering specialisation provides the student with the ability to acquire a hybrid range of skills based on mechanics, electronics and computing. Whilst there is a comprehensive coverage of mechanical engineering and design areas, the stream enables a deeper understanding of the principles supporting the conception, design, construction, maintenance, integration and repair of intelligent machines. Typical examples of these machines are robots, white goods, cameras, automated test equipment and transport vehicles.
Typical fields which may be encompassed by the program include building services, computer controlled plant, manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles. An emphasis is placed on the application of engineering science, development and management in these fields.

Enrolment Disclaimer
Please note that this Handbook is a comprehensive catalogue of our offerings and includes courses that can be taken to satisfy program requirements irrespective as to their availability for a particular year.  Availability of courses is best checked using filters on this site or on the
class timetable
site.
You are responsible for ensuring that you enrol in courses according to your program requirements and by following the advice of your Program Authority. myUNSW enrolment checks that you have met enrolment requirements such as pre-requisites for individual courses but not that you are enrolling in courses that will count towards your program requirements.
Additional Information
Thesis Arrangements
Students complete a sequence of thesis courses (MMAN4951, MMAN4952 and MMAN4953 - subject to approval) in consecutive terms in the final year of their candidature.
These enrolments represent a single thesis project that is developed and completed over the duration of the full set of thesis courses. On conclusion of the last thesis course a final overall mark is added to all thesis courses.
Under exceptional circumstances and with School permission, students may apply to enrol in MMAN4952 and MMAN4953 concurrently.
Students in the BE(Hons)/BiomedE program must complete the following Biomedical Engineering Thesis courses in place of the thesis courses offered their BE (Hons) specialisations: BIOM4951, BIOM4952 and BIOM4953.
Students who fail thesis may have to repeat, restart or change thesis projects depending on the circumstances. Please see
