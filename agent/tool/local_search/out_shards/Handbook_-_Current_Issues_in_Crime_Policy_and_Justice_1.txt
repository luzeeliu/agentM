This course examines shifting notions of crime policy and justice. It considers multiple meanings of crime and justice such as governing through crime, Indigenous innovations, creation of criminality, discretionary powers, and securitisation. Current issues are studied from diverse perspectives, including critical criminology, decolonial approaches, and the political economy of surveillance and security. Students are encouraged to think deeply about what it means to deliver justice and build community safety, and to engage with crime policy in economic, social, political and cultural contexts. Recent developments and ongoing debates are regularly updated to accommodate interests expressed by students.
