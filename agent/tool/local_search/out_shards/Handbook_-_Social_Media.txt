Social media is a huge part of life today and, for better or worse, an important arena for media professionals to get their messages across. In this course you will learn how to analyse social media platforms and communication. We will draw on a range of contemporary social media research to understand the kinds of social and political power held by these platforms, and the critical implications of their design and governance. The course involves practical case studies in which we will investigate how identities are performed and communities are formed through close analysis of social media texts and datasets. In doing so, you will also reflect on your own social media practices, and how you might use social media in your professional future.
