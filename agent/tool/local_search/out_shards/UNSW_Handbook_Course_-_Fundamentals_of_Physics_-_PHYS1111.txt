Description
This is an introductory level course in physics for students from all disciplines.The course will cover the methods of Physics, including the folowing topics: the description of motion; forces and momentum; the dynamics of particles; kinetic and potential energy; the conservation of energy; temperature and thermal equilibrium; specific and latent heat; thermal energy; fluids and fluid flow; oscillations and simple harmonic motion; waves, wave reflection, refraction and interference; the wave nature of light; electric fields and charge; electric potential and energy; electric currents; magnetism; electromagnetic induction and Faraday’s law; early quantum theory and models of the atom; nuclear physics and radioactivity; nuclear energy.
Note:
There is no Assumed Knowledge for this course. It also serves as a suitable introduction to Physics for students whose Program requires them to take PHYS1121 or PHYS1131 but who do not have the recommended level of Assumed Knowledge for these courses.
