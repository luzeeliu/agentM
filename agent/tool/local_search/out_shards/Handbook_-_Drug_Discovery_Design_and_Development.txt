This course will explore the process of drug discovery, design and development, from project and target identification to final drug registration. It will examine the principles and methodology behind project and target selection, hit discovery, high-throughput screening assays, as well as lead identification and optimisation. Safety evaluation, clinical trials, and the essentials of intellectual property, regulatory affairs and commercialisation will also be discussed.
