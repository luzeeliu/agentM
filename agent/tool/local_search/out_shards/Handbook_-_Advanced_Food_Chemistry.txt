In the era marked by rising life expectancy and looming threat of climate change, fostering a healthy population, and ensuring sustainable food production are crucial national priorities. How does food influence our quality of life? In what way can food contribute to healing and how can advancements of food science mitigate the impacts of climate change? These are the grand challenging questions that demand innovative scientific and technological solutions in the future.
Welcome to Advanced Food Chemistry. In this course, you will develop the knowledge base and technical skills to control and manipulate food molecules and their reactions. You will learn how to stabilise food molecules to prolong shelf life (e.g., food additives), how to make food more appealing and pleasant to eat (e.g., food colourants and food flavours), how to make food processing more environmentally sustainable (e.g., food enzymes), and how to make foods that heal (e.g., bioactive phytochemicals). By integrating food chemistry knowledge and skills into food science and technology, you will be able to design and formulate innovative food products of your desire.
