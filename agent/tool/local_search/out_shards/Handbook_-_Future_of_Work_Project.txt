COMM2244 is a project based practicum aimed at developing and applying students’ skills, capabilities and knowledge of future workplaces.
You will learn and practice the skills required to be successful as an individual - curiosity, creativity, empathy, and courage. You will examine how these factors underpin future career success in a rapidly changing global landscape, taking into account emerging technologies, artificial intelligence and other globalisation factors.
Guided by your lecturer and as part of a small team, you will apply these skills and capabilities to a real-life business challenge for an industry partner. Your client will present a problem related to their future workforce and, in project teams, students will investigate this challenge, workshop solutions, and provide a recommended way forward.
Each experience will be different depending on the organisations we partner with.
For enquiries please contact the Career Accelerator team.
