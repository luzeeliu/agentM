How do competitive programmers solve complex problems in a matter of minutes?

You will discover sophisticated applications of dynamic programming, data structures, graph algorithms, mathematics and more. Most importantly, you will learn to deconstruct a problem in order to evaluate which algorithm design techniques are appropriate, combining ideas from different contexts, and address the challenges that lie in both solving the problem conceptually and producing a C/C++ program which enacts your solution.
