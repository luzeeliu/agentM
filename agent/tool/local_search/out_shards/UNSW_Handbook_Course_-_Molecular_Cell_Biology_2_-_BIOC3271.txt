Description
Cell biology from a molecular viewpoint; biochemical aspects of cellular organisation; the arrangement of the component molecules of organelles, their function in integrated cellular metabolism and the molecular interactions between the cells of multicellular organisms; the biochemistry of the cytoskeleton, carriers and intracellular transport systems; the regulation of cellular processes at the molecular endocrine level; growth differentiation and development; aspects of cancer metabolism, the biochemistry of cell to cell communication and the structure and function of the extracellular matrix. Practical work amplifies the lectures.
