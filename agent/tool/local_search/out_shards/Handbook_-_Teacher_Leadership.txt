This course offers an account of the nature of teacher leadership, and how it can be developed and exercised, from the broad perspective of leadership as a form of influence as opposed to the narrower perspective of administrative role. Teacher leadership is construed as a form of distributed leadership, with the boundaries of influence extending beyond the immediate workplace. The course thus deals with teachers as leaders in their profession, as leaders of other teachers, within the community, as leaders of students, as well as in administrative roles and especially within contexts for influencing teaching and learning. This breadth of topics will be constrained by a common theme of how teacher leaders can promote student learning outcomes. Of particular interest will be the changing role of teachers as leaders in light of the expanding place of autonomous student learning that Internet resources have afforded.
