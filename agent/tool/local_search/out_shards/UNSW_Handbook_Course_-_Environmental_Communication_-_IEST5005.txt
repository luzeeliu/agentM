Description
Effective communication about environmental issues is of pressing importance. We are bombarded by messages from a wide range of sources telling us how to think and feel about the unprecedented ecological impacts of humanity. This course addresses questions such as: How are environmental issues communicated to the public? How is information presented and interpreted? What motivates people to take action to care for the environment, and what leads to behavioural change? How can campaigns be most effective in helping people understand the causes and conditions for environmental problems? You will explore a range of environmental campaigns and their impacts, including on awareness and behaviour change. Values-driven environmental communications are explored in theory and practice. A diverse range of practitioners who design and lead environmental campaigns will share their experiences. You will deepen your theoretical understandings and practical abilities in designing social change campaigns for environmental issues.
