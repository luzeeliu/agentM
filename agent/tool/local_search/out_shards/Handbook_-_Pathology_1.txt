Pathology is a scientific discipline which involves the study of disease. Pathology provides an understanding of the causes of disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the symptoms, and potential complications of disease. An understanding of pathological process is also essential to guide the development of new diagnostic tests and novel treatments for a range of diseases including Cancer and Covid-19.
Undergraduate Pathology involves the study of various disease processes including inflammation, wound healing, vascular diseases, immunological responses, musculoskeletal diseases and cancers. Students become familiar with examining macroscopic specimens of diseased tissue, microscopic differences between normal and abnormal cells, tissues and organs as well as interpretation of basic diagnostic laboratory investigations and imaging. Much of the study of microscopic abnormalities is undertaken using computer-based 'virtual' microscopy. Students also become familiar with the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of disease. Courses offered in Pathology allow in-depth study of many fascinating and important disorders such as meningitis, tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases, genetic diseases, a variety of cancers, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, asthma, musculoskeletal diseases and even COVID-19.
Some examples of careers that students studying Pathology may pursue include:
Medical researcher (including in government, industry or university laboratories);
Laboratory technician;
Pharmaceutical sales representative;
Medical-scientific liaison;
Regulatory affairs officer.
