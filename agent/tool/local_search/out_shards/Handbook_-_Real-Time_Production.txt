This studio elective introduces you to foundational concepts, processes, and techniques for creating real-time CGI environments for projects in animation, visual effects, and related areas. The course is designed to extend your knowledge of digital compositing principles and techniques and provide new skills that enhance your broader creative practice. Throughout the course, you will develop understandings of real-time workflows by combining CGI assets, scenes, and environments with live action footage. As part of a supportive studio environment, you will be encouraged to experiment with new approaches and concepts, as well as integrate technical workflows that can be applied in future projects.
