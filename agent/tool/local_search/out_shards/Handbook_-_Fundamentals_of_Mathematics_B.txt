This course will provide you with a basic working knowledge of Calculus and will show you how these topics can be applied in interdisciplinary contexts.  You will see analytical thinking and problem solving demonstrated in lectures, and you will have an opportunity to develop your own analytical thinking and problem solving skills in tutorial classes.  This course will enhance your ability to solve problems using logical arguments and techniques, which are generic skills that can be applied in multidisciplinary work.  The course will also engage you in independent and reflective learning through your homework problems. You are encouraged to develop your communication skills through active participation in tutorials, and by writing clear, logical arguments when solving problems.
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
