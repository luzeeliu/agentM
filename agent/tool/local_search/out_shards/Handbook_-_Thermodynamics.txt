This course introduces the students to the terminology, principles and methods used in engineering thermodynamics.
The word “thermodynamics” was coined by Lord Kelvin from Greek words for heat (therme) and power (dynamis). Given that power is the rate at which work is performed, it follows that the word thermodynamics captures two of the most important ways in which energy is transferred, i.e. through heat and work. The subject of thermodynamics is therefore about energy and its transformations.
Thermodynamics has a broad application area ranging from microscopic organisms to common household appliances, transportation vehicles, power generation systems and even philosophy. The knowledge of thermodynamics gained in this course is essential to many other courses studied in mechanical engineering degree programme, such as advanced thermofluids, aerospace propulsion,
internal combustion engines, refrigeration, air conditioning and solar energy.
This introductory course covers basic concepts of thermodynamics: Systems, property, state, path, process; Work and heat; Properties of pure substances; Tables of properties and equations of state; First law of thermodynamics; Analysis of closed and open systems; Second law of thermodynamics; Carnot cycle; Clausius inequality, entropy, irreversibility, isentropic efficiencies; Air-standard cycles; Vapour cycles.
