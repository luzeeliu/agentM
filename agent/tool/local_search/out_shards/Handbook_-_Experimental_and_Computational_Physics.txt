The intended audience is primarily Level 3 undergraduates taking a Physics major, for which this course is a core component. The purpose of this course is to improve experimental skills through hands-on laboratory work, and to improve computational skills through learning Python and using Jupyter Notebook. The key topics include the statistical analysis of data, sampling and information theory, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations, Fourier transform theory and discrete Fourier transforms, spectroscopy, numerical modelling of noise and stochastic processes, inverse problems, experimental control, nonlinear systems, and quantum measurements. The course will consist of a lecture component (40%) and a laboratory component (60%). The Higher Year Laboratory offers a large range of interesting experiments for students to select from, covering many key concepts and techniques in Physics.
