This course provides advanced tuition in Chinese language (Mandarin) study, using a textbook designed specifically for advanced Chinese learners at universities outside of China. It combines language studies with an exploration of Chinese culture and society, including traditional culture. The medium of instruction is Mandarin. You continue to develop and extend your understanding and use of the Chinese language, especially more specialized vocabulary, and complex sentence structures. The emphasis is on the transformation of linguistic knowledge into active skills through oral and written activities, focusing on authentic Chinese texts by utilising various reading strategies. The choice of text and related materials are based on two criteria: 1) They should serve as a sample of the best language for students to learn and imitate, and 2) The contents of each text should have a strong relevance with current Chinese society and cultural tradition. The texts cover a wide range of topics in Chinese language, culture, and society, including a speech by the renowned short story writer and 2012 Nobel prize winner for literature, Mo Yan. These carefully chosen texts will serve as a window through which you will see China at work, feeling its
qi
and greatness while also being aware of its challenges and problems.
