This course considers contemporary legal issues in international criminal law. It places international criminal law in the broader context of state sovereignty, international peace and security, post-conflict reconciliation and the rule of law. It examines the role of international criminal law within public international law generally, and its relationship with other areas of law, such as state responsibility, human rights, international humanitarian law, national criminal law and international refugee law. It will examine the distinction between state and individual responsibility, consider the development of international criminal law and its institutions and outline the main principles and rules of international criminal law, both substantive and procedural. In particular, the course will examine the substantive legal framework to ensure accountability for acts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international law.
Main Topics

The development and operation of the Nuremberg Tribunal, the ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court;
