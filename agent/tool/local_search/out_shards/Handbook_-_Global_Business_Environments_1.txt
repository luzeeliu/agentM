DPBS1100 explored the fundamental decisions that managers need to make to keep the organisation running successfully and did so from the perspective of a structured environment.  However, businesses do not operate in isolation: an organisation and the decisions their managers make exist in broader, often complex and dynamic environments. DPBS1150 now introduces the interplay of organisations with their environmental contexts to achieve both commercial and societal value. It prompts students to investigate global business environments with economic, legal, political, socio-technological, ethical and sustainability lenses to sense disruptions and opportunities. This includes an understanding of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) and UNSW’s commitment to both.
Students will become familiar with the nature and role of business in society and understand the forces that drive their strategic interactions within the global business environment. The overarching purpose of this course is to provide students with a ‘big picture’ understanding of business success.
Link to other courses: DPBS1150 is the second compulsory course in the Bachelor of Commerce and builds on Business Development Management (DPBS1100). Understanding the global business environment assist with a deeper comprehension of shared value creation (DPBS1180) and resource management (DPBS1170).
Course outline information is accessible via Moodle for enrolled students.
