ARCH7113 aims to prepare you for your final-year Graduation Studio and post-graduate professional work by consolidating your design competency with an emphasis on the principles, modes and tools of architectural documentation. Documentation is the process of resolving, detailing and communicating an architectural project through all project stages. Documentation includes the use of drawings, models, specifications and schedules to communicate design intent and construction details.
You will develop design and documentation skills through assessment tasks mapped to the Detail Design and Documentation of an architectural assembly or detail building component. Detail Design will address the integration of regulatory, structural, services, constructional and material requirements. Documentation will focus on the preparation of resolved 3D models and coordinated drawings, schedules and specifications of quality and performance standards in relation to materials, finishes, fittings and systems.
ARCH7113 logically builds on the design integration processes introduced in ARCH7112 (Integrated Design Studio 1) by reinforcing the regulatory, environmental and communication knowledge, skills and application required for the practice of architecture. Through the development of design and documentation competencies, you will build capacity to produce fit-for-purpose documentation at different project stages that progressively conform to accepted standards of professional architectural practice.
