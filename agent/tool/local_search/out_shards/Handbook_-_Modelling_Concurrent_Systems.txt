This course tries to make students familiar with state-of-the-art  techniques in modelling concurrent systems. This is done by comparing  some of the more successful models of concurrency found in the  literature. The focus will be on the rationale behind the design  decisions underlying those models, viewed from philosophical,  mathematical and computational perspectives. The course contains  important background knowledge for students aiming at a scientific  career in which the design of mathematical models of system behaviour is  a component.
Topics chosen from: semantic models of  concurrent and distributed systems (e.g. process algebra, event  structures, Petri nets, Chu spaces), operational and denotational  semantics, semantic equivalences and implementation relations, linear  versus branching time, interleaving versus partial order semantics, true  concurrency, algorithms for equivalence checking and their complexity,  modal and temporal logic for concurrent systems.
