The course examines ways in which intergovernmental organisations, agreements and other international processes can advance social justice. It is concerned with both the global level, especially within the UN system, and also the regional level in groupings such as the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations.
The course focuses principally on organisations, agreements and practices which establish or closely affect economic and social rights, especially in the context of rapid economic and technological globalisation. Special attention is given to the role of civil society organisations in the processes by which such organisations, agreements and practices can be developed, monitored and enforced.
