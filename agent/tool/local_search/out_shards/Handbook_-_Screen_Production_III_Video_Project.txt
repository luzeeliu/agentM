This course provides practical experience in video-making and gives you an understanding of the basic concepts that underlie a video production, from script to final cut. You will have the opportunity to create a range of short video works with an emphasis on conceptual innovation. You are encouraged to look for practical solutions to theoretical problems concerning film/video that you may have encountered during your film and media courses. You will improve your competence in the technical skills of operating a camera, lighting, scripting, pre-production planning, editing and presentation. The course aims to increase your practical knowledge and awareness of film language, style, process, and technique by way of craft-based functional workshop exercises, independent assembly, and a substantial group-generated production process. You will develop your capacity for critical analysis through the evaluation of a range of short films, production processes of your own work and that of your peers. The course supports you to develop collaborative working practices to a professional standard through the conceiving, scripting, pre-production, and production of a proof-of-concept short film. These films will be programmed into an end-of-term screening and can be included in your showreel or professional portfolio.
