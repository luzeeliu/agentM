Description
The course would focus on the inherent environmental challenges that face the “developing world”, including a critique of neoliberal models of economic growth and development. The subject takes an international perspective, focusing on the role of environmental conventions and the impact of global governance strategies, such as the ‘millennium development goals', in achieving a more sustainable approach to development. This subject would be of particular interest to students interested in international governance, the role of civil society, and government in developing countries. Topics would include: International development frameworks and governance; International trade, environment and development; Food security - the green and gene revolutions; Energy and development; Climate change implications for the developing world; Indigenous rights and gender – their role in environmental management; Debt, poverty and the environment; Community participation in development; and related topics.
