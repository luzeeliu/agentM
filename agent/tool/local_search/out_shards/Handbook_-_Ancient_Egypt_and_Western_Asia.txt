In this course, we will study the three thousand year history of ancient Egypt, the world's first nation state.  This journey will take us from the prehistoric period, into the Old Kingdom and its pyramid builders, right through to the New Kingdom and rulers such as Ramesses the Great and Tutankhamun, and finally through Egypt's decline and eventual conquest by Persia and then Macedon.  As well as delving into the lengthy and complex history of this fascinating land, we will examine Egyptian religion, life and culture, consider some of Egypts astounding monuments, as well as reading a number of the most impressive surviving literary texts.  In the course of these investigations, we will also keep an eye on developments in Egypt's neighbours in the Near East, Africa and Greece.
