Candidates may be admitted to the PhD program after one year's full-time enrolment in a Masters by Research program, if they meet the PhD entry requirements and with the approval of the Faculty Higher Degree Committee.
In exceptional cases an applicant who submits evidence of such other academic and professional qualifications as may be approved by the Committee may be permitted to enrol for the degree.
