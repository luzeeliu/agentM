Why do poverty, hunger, and conflict still persist—despite decades of global effort? And how is it that, even with all warnings from scientists, we’re pushing the planet beyond its limits, facing crises like climate change and mass biodiversity loss?
What if these challenges aren’t isolated, but deeply interconnected? What if the way we do business could be part of the solution?
This course invites you on a journey to explore the complex relationships between social, environmental, and economic issues—and to examine the root causes driving today’s most urgent global problems. Using a systems thinking approach, you’ll learn to analyse sustainability challenges, identify key leverage points for change, and assess the real-world impacts of corporate strategies and governance practices.
You’ll also develop practical skills in collaboration, communication, and self-leadership—equipping you to drive meaningful, positive change.
If you've ever wondered whether it’s still possible to make a meaningful difference—this course is for you.
