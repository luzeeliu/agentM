This is an elective course for 3rd or 4th year undergraduate students of Materials Science & Engineering focusing on the fundamentals of process and physical metallurgy principles, some of which have been introduced in 1st year (e.g., in MATS1192 ‘Design and Application of Materials in Science and Engineering’).  The first part of this course focuses on traditional and modern processes required to refine iron from ores into iron and steel. Students will also learn how to describe and evaluate recent major developments in the steel industry, and how to apply this knowledge to identify areas for improvement in terms of the sustainability of these processes. The second part focuses on the physical metallurgy of simple steels before exploring the process metallurgy of specialty alloys and non-ferrous alloys. Prior knowledge of the basic principles governing processing-microstructure-property relationships of alloys will be expanded to consider various factors affecting the final properties of semi-finished metal products such as thermo-mechanical treatments, segregation, complex heat treatments, additive processing routes, workflows during non-ferrous processing, energy consumption, and other environmental aspects. This is a face-to-face course with live lectures and tutorials.
