INFS2608 is a Level 2 Information Systems (IS) course that continues students’ study of IS by covering various advanced topics pertinent to Big Data. Building upon the principles and theoretical fundamentals taught in INFS1603, students will learn to apply data design to Big Data systems, specifically data warehousing. Through this course students will be taught the complexities of Big Data systems through business case studies.
Students will learn to distinguish the elements that make up Big Data and appraise the journey of building Big Data from start to finish. It is crucial for students to be able to evaluate the design and architecture of Big Data technology. This will cover emerging technologies and trends in Database Design, Data Management and Big Data.
