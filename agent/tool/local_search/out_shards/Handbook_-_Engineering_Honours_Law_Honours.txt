Please note that students cannot enrol directly into this program. It is designed for those intending to undertake Honours in the LLB, and eligible students will be transferred into the program through an internal process.
Engineering (Honours) 3707
Students are required to complete a 168 Units of Credit (UOC) specialisation within the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program. In addition, students must undertake a minimum of 60 days of approved Industrial Training as part of the program requirements.
4702 Law (Honours)
4702 Law (Honours) is an embedded Honours program. It is for high-achieving undergraduate double law students whose performance over the course of the law component of their double law program (where the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) is an AQF Level 7 qualification), and their completion of Honours-level research requirements, demonstrates that they have met the AQF Level 8 outcomes of a Bachelor (Honours) program in law.
Students will never enrol in 4702 Law (Honours) as a stand-alone program. Rather, 4702 Law (Honours) is intended to be the ‘shell’ Honours program, to be combined with a large number of undergraduate programs offered by other Faculties at UNSW.
Explanation of operation
Students wishing to undertake undergraduate law at UNSW will still initially enrol in a double degree program, one award in which will be the LLB. For students who commenced their LLB studies in or after 2015, if they wish to graduate with an Honours degree, they will be required to transfer to another double degree program, one award in which will be the LLB (Honours), and complete two additional courses as part of the LLB (Honours) program. By way of illustration, a school-leaver might wish to enrol in 4733 BCom/LLB. If that student meets the eligibility criteria to transfer into the LLB (Honours), that student will be transferred at that stage to a new BCom/LLB (Honours) double degree program.
Transfer will be via Internal Program Transfer, at the end of Term 1 or Term 3.
