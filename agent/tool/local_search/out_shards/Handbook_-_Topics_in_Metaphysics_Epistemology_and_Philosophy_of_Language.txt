At a time when distinguishing between knowledge and ‘spin’ in media, politics, and business is more important than ever, it is important to get clear on what is involved in knowing something, in being accurate in what one says or thinks, in saying or thinking something meaningful at all. Are there such things as truth and knowledge? What are they, and how could we arrive at them? Even more fundamentally, what is meaningful speech or thought? And is there an objective reality for our speech and thought to represent? These are the sorts of questions explored in this advanced course.?You will learn about key ideas and approaches in contemporary analytic?philosophy, through an in-depth engagement with topics selected from among the areas of epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. Precise topics and areas represented may vary in different iterations of the course.
