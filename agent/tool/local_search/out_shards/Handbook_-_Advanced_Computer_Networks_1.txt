We study network protocols and architectures used in data centres, software-defined networking and content distribution networks. We also study network security, network measurements and network models. The course consists of both a reading/lecture/discussion component and a project component. We will read research papers on recent topics in computer networking. Students are expected to carry out a research project including analysis, design, and implementation (when appropriate) on a novel subject. The projects can be one of the following types: algorithm design applied to networked system, implementation of a novel networking system, measurement of existing network protocols, and simulation of a proposed network algorithm.
