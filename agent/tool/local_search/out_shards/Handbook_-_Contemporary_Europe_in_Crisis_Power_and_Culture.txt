Contemporary Europe in Crisis: Power and Culture
explores the unprecedented challenges facing contemporary Europe, through academic analysis, political commentary, film and novels. The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to a referendum passing 'Brexit', indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship between Europe and the USA in the aftermath of the Trump presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe's ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism. This course will introduce the social, cultural and political crisis in contemporary Europe through a cultural lens.
