EDST6100 Work Integrated Learning Placement Capstone provides you an opportunity to gain experience in an educational setting through Work Integrated learning. You will undertake project-based learning to observe, document and report on the dynamics, requirements, and expectations of an educational setting in a non-school environment. Aligned with the UNSW’s emphasis on work integrated learning (WIL), this real-life experience in a supervised industry setting allows you to enhance your disciplinary knowledge of education and to learn about how educators apply their theoretical knowledge and skills in a learning context. The course supports your placement experience with a reading program and seminars that examine scholarly perspectives on professional practice, including the study of pedagogical practice and professional development.
Placement opportunities will be subject to availability as arranged by the School.
