The biomedical engineering masters project allows coursework masters students to experience research training either within the School or with collaborating institutions such as hospitals and CSIRO. These projects offer a distinctive chance for you to merge the engineering principles you've acquired throughout your prior years of study, and apply these principles to address unresolved engineering challenges in the realm of human health. Projects are selected by the student in consultation with a supervisor conducting research in an area of interest to the student. If the research topic selected is external to the School/University, the student must arrange for an internal GSBmE co-supervisor/assessor.
BIOM9020 (6 UOC) is the first half of the 12 UOC research project. BIOM9021 (6 UOC) is the second half. Enrolment in these courses allows a student to undertake the equivalent of BIOM9914 Masters Project over two terms. You must discuss the research project with your supervisor and get their approval prior to enrolling in this BIOM9020. Satisfactory performance in BIOM9020 will enable you to then complete BIOM9021. Candidates must contact the School for consent to enrol.
In Week 7 of each term eligible students should receive an email inviting them to view the Biomedical Engineering Projects database and select their project preferences. You should then identify potential projects and discuss these projects with potential supervisors prior to commencing this course. If you have not received a communication by Week 8 about project selection, then please reach out to the course coordinator for access to the Biomedical Engineering Projects database.
