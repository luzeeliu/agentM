In this course, you will study Confucianism and Daoism (Taoism), philosophies which originated from China and which continue to influence thinking and practices in China and beyond. You will also learn about lesser-known Chinese philosophies including Mohism, Legalism and Chinese Buddhism. The course Investigates a range of topics in early Chinese philosophy such as ethics and politics, conceptions of knowledge, and views of reality and the world. We discuss how the early thinkers in China thought about these issues and draws on their insights to enhance contemporary debates. Although the course will focus on a study of traditional Chinese philosophies, it will also consider comparative east-west perspectives and their contemporary relevance.
Note: No previous knowledge of Chinese culture or language is assumed.
