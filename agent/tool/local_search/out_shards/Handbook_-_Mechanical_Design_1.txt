This course has been designed to build upon the systematic approach to problem-solving and design that was previously introduced in other related coursework. The primary focus of this course will be mathematical modelling for design applications, including the analysis of force flow through components and assemblies, the design of dynamically-loaded bolted connections and welded joints, as well as the design of power transmission systems such as shafts, gears, belt and chain drives, and the selection of rolling element bearings for specific applications. Through the exploration of these concepts, students will gain practical knowledge and skills relevant to real-world engineering applications.
