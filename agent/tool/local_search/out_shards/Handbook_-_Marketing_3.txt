The UNSW Business School Marketing Honours program aims to recruit a small number of elite UNSW marketing students and endow them with conceptual, analytical and research skills to set them apart from other marketing graduates in Australia. The program is designed to provide the best of our students with a distinct competitive advantage in the job market, through differentiation based on extended set of analytical and research skills, rigorous understanding of marketing theory and its application to practice in a small classroom setting and with individualized attention by our research faculty. The resulting thesis is judged by the department on rigorous criteria and is honed into a research contribution that contributes to the discipline. This gives our Honours graduates the ability to command a price premium in the job market.
The objective of the program from the academic perspective is also to facilitate the research culture at the UNSW School of Marketing (SoM), and expand opportunities for employment and/or continued doctoral study for our honours graduates.
The program is only offered full time with students being admitted in Term 1.
