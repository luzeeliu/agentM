This specialisation is only offered on a full-time basis with commencement in Term 1 or Term 2 each year.
The Honours year will provide students with an opportunity to learn the necessary skills to tackle the financial issues and challenges that they will encounter throughout their careers. These skills include analytical skills in problem solving (identification of problems, mapping out solutions and executing them) and financial (both practical and academic) research skills.
To satisfy the Honours requirements, students undertake an additional year of study, completing Honours level courses (both compulsory and elective) and undertaking a research thesis. Students must have completed the prerequisite courses prior to their Honours year.
